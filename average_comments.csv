10,Great job!
11,Nice work! Have you seen this article?
12,Great job!  I was able to attend the 2015 Thon as a spectator and it was a singular fantastic experience.  Energy in the building was off the chart.
13,Congratulations!  There is nothing I like more than the drums in a marching band.
14,Sounds like a fantastic cultural experience.  I have also visited Germany on several occasions.
15,I was fortunate to attend Thon in 2015 as a spectator when my daughter danced.  I agree with you that it is one of the highlights in my life the caring and energy in the building was something to behold.

35,Beaver Stadium is really unlike any other place in the world. Hours of driving through PA with nothing but small towns and then you see one of the biggest stadiums in the world in what seems like the middle of nowhere. Even if there are so many thousands of people at every game going there is an experience unique to you as a Penn State student.
36,Nashville is an amazing city and to handle the navigation required to get there is no small accomplishment if you haven't traveled long distances before. Great reflection!

108,Interesting comments for a stir fry dinner!  Who won the contest for eating the most?
109,That is also the job I did for one summer many years ago.  Did you have any close calls falling off as I did?
110,Interesting how such a small social event can build bonds to create a better team.
111,Good comments.  In the engineering world ideas can be relatively easy to come by but the execution is not always so easy.
112,Best of luck to you.  Did you cover the security aspect of this type of app?
113,and how might it differ from one group member to another?
114,Thank you Carolyn! This is a great point to remember come SHO Time this August. While we cannot force our mentees to put away their phones we can encourage them to stay involved in their immediate surroundings as the relationships they make during SHO Time will remain with them for the rest of their lives at PSU!
115,I bet Penn State outsiders would be amazed to see that we were able to fit so much excitement into just one day!  It's truly a testament to the rich and exciting atmosphere of State College and the adventure-seeking attitudes of the students who live there.  I hope we can still find some more exciting things to do to bond with our committee come August!
116,Glad to see that you have a personal connection with the Arboretum! When do you find yourself going there most often?
117,"How did learning this """"downward dog"""" yoga pose impact your way of thinking? Do you think that now after learning this pose and realizing how challenging it was it will prompt you to try out more yoga classes to improve your flexibility?"
118,Nice! Glad to see that you are learning new skills no matter how trivial they might be.
119,I'm glad your fellow mentors were able to teach you some new skills! Never underestimate the importance of Snapchat you never know when the skill of using 2 filters at once will come in handy.
120,Bhangra is probably one of the coolest types of Indian dance (in my opinion) and hard to teach so props to you!
121,Glad you're enjoying Penn State so far!
122,Do you think this learning experience will prompt you to try to learn more Mandarin in the future?
123,Casey this is a really great mission statement! It is very important in life to think about independence and using this as motivation will guarantee your success.
124,Haley I really like how your mission statement revolves around helping others and that you use that mission in both your professional and your personal life. With that attitude you will definitely be able to change the world!
125,Penn State is definitely an exciting place to spend a day or even a full four years! The activities that you mentioned seem like great ways to meet new people and build a sense of community. It seems like you have no shortage of school pride!
126,Sounds like like a nice relaxing night of making new friends! Penn State definitely contains a multitude of enjoyable activities and they're even more enjoyable when done with a group of friends. It's important to build camaraderie with your peers especially if you'll be working closely with them.
127,Glad you found a way to share your skills with someone else!
128,"Cara I really liked your selection of the """"Modern Limits"""" and your analysis of it. I think that idea reflects how a lot of us feel when we transitioned to college"
129,I would have to agree with you about the football Zach!  I too have very little interest in football itself yet every year I find myself buying a season ticket because I can't get enough of the atmosphere.  I think I said this on someone else's reflection as well
130,I'm taking a yoga class this summer so I'm anticipating the same revelations that you expressed here. Now I still cannot 'whip' as I'm told that I look like Hillary Clinton whenever I attempt it. I hope you had fun with your skill swap experience!
131,I love the Arboretum! I went there for the first time this spring and I've spent quite a good deal of time there this summer. I grew up in the woods doing nature camps and hiking and whatnot too so it really is a slice of childhood. Good reflection maybe you could take your SHO TIME group there in the fall!
132,Wow that's an intense language! I'm always amazed at how diverse language really is. I only speak English and a bit of Spanish so props to Cameron for going the distance. I'm glad the experience was gratifying!
133,Sounds interesting! I would love to hear more about World in Conversation - I've never heard of it before. It's really cool that you know some Chinese knowing another language is scientifically proven to alter how you think. Good work.
134,Hey mentee! I'm glad that you connected with some other mentors it'll be good to know your fellow mentors in the fall. I need you to teach me how to dance I'm hopeless on the dance floor. I'm so proud of you for becoming a mentor this year and I know you'll do great things with my grand-mentees!
135,It's cool seeing this experience from three different sides. I'm really glad you three got to know each other better. Hopefully we'll have a lot of interesting snapchat filters for you and your mentees to bond over come SHO TIME! Cool post!
136,"I love how you made all those connections just by playing """"I Spy"""". Really cool! I'm glad you had this experience. I hope your summer has been full of good weather and a nice and light workload. Can't wait to see what memories your group makes come fall!"
137,Thanks for temporarily joining our group Matt! Remember the lessons we learned on Old Main when SHO Time rolls around this August!
138,Very neat Alex! It seems like you learned a lot from this unique holiday! We can realize the beauty of cultural variance when we experience a way of life or celebration outside of our normal routines. Thank you for sharing!
139,I'm really glad that in doing this exercise you came out with something different than you were expecting. I think an important part of the mission statement is not to sound good (even though yours does) but to be honest with it.
140,"It's good to have a space at school where you can feel comfortable and maybe even """"at home."""" My family used to go camping once a year together and I miss that time spent enjoying with them. I unfortunately haven't found my own space but I guess I'll have to check out the arboretum sometime soon! I haven't explored it too much but I have enjoyed lying in the grass all the way in the back. A little bit of sun is healthy! Finding a way to destress is also very healthy."
141,People watching is one of my favorite things to do - you learn so much about human behavior! It is especially interesting to do so at an airport. You see such a huge range of emotions! I'm happy to hear that you are constantly thinking about your leadership role and I'm sure that will be very useful once SHO TIME starts. I'm excited to hear about your success as a mentor and about how your relationship with your mentees develops.
142,I can absolutely relate to your second painting choice. I had no final exams during finals week but I had an insane amount of work leading up to that week. Several presentations papers and graded assignments. Time management is definitely the hardest but most valuable thing I've learned since I started school at Penn State.
143,This sounds like an incredible undertaking! I've never worked in business or management but I do have experience promoting things. This year I founded the first annual high school tournament for the PSU Mock Trial Association. Getting something like that off the ground is tough work so I appreciate the effort you are describing and I congratulate you on your success! This type of work ethic is what we need to make this year's SHO TIME a success!
144,I hope you get to go on more mission trips with some groups at PSU.  There are numerous groups that do various missions around both the US and the world (often at Spring break as well.)
145,Kara I\'m so happy for you that you\'ve found a dream career path. Lots of people struggle with this aspect of college! How was the first women\'s exhibition game? I would love to hear more via another post or comment. -Emily
146,Courtney- Your experience in Junior ROTC is really impressive. How have you continued to practice leadership skills in college?
147,Courtney- Thanks for sharing your experience helping your teammates. As an HDFS major you will definitely use emotional intelligence and teamwork in your future. I\'m a fifth year graduate student in HDFS and if you are looking for research or other opportunities in HDFS I would be happy to help (eaw237@psu.edu).
148,Celine- I\'m glad you were able to learn from this valuable role modeling. However it\'s unclear what your involvement was in the incident. It would be great to see more posts about things you\'ve done especially here at Penn State.
149,Anya This is a great post. It was interesting to hear about your interest in art and creativity. You should consider taking a class at the Center for Arts and Crafts- really fun and great for amateurs! (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/hub/craftcenter/)
150,Wow Liza what a story! I would have been very stressed if I had to teach a class on the fly. You should consider being an undergrad TA during your time at Penn State- talk to instructors and other undergrad TAs.
151,Michelle- can\'t wait to hear about more of your leadership positions. I love all the details in this post.
152,"Melanie- Thanks for sharing. I would definitely add \""""Initiative\"""" to the list of skills you used here."
153,Sara- This is a really intense story thank you for sharing! Being an EMT is great experience as a BBH major. I\'m interested to hear more about your Penn State experiences as you go on.
154,This is a great story. Especially for recruiters to see you leadership skills and philanthropy. This is a really good post.
155,"Your wording can be improve in the beginning of this post. \""""I developed the soft skill of self-awareness since i could look back on my actions\"""" is an awkward sentence. Very wordy too. There isn\'t much flow to this post. You jump from family hiking story to your brother\'s leadership skill at Penn State. Try to focus on the flow of your post next entry. I like at the end you talk about one of your leadership skills. However I think you should consider revising this post."
156,Love that you went with your group. Great post. This is what we want in a post
157,Good post. I think you should aware of speaking in passive voice. Also your sentence structure can use work. But the skills displayed are exactly what we are looking for
158,"There is a good flow to your post. Im kind of confused how the skill \""""diversity\"""" fits in but thats something you can flesh out."
159,I like the honesty. Next time try to reflect more while you are in the area about your history and/or how something you see has sparked a revelation of a skill you have or may want to develop
160,"Alaina here\'s a story for you: when I was younger I was pretty shy but now my friends know me as \""""SO good at meeting people.\"""" I now love talking to strangers and going to events alone- it\'s the best way to meet new people! Plus making new connections will make your career and life much better. As I found this is something that comes with practice. Set a benchmark for yourself to have a conversation with someone new each day. You\'ll learn some interesting things and it\'ll become a habit."
161,Interesting and succinct descriptions of three very different artwork choices.  Do you think you they might also have some sort of connectedness also?  I would ask you this if I was talking to you about this post.
162,Interesting and succinct descriptions of your chosen artwork that really show some deeper thinking on your part as well as letting a bit of your personality and values shine through.
163,Interesting and succinct description of your chosen artwork that really shows some deeper thinking on your part as well as letting a bit of your personality and values shine through.
164,Interesting and succinct description of your chosen artwork that really shows some deeper thinking on your part as well as letting a bit of your personality and values shine through.  Good explanation of how this painting reflects your experiences with the Four Diamonds fund.
165,Liza this sounds like a very rewarding experience and use of your time.  It sounds like you differentiated to meet the needs of each learner which is key to rapid learning growth.  Some folks would have goofed off without the lead teacher being in the room so cheers to your initiative.  I would encourage you to think of more events where you should initiative and put them on Live It to allow instructors mentors and recruiters to see your hard work. Feel free to reach out: dknicely@liveitu.com
166,Melanie I\'m so glad you shared this experience as it truly captures a great opportunity from your high school work that translates clearly to college and beyond.  I also served as a student council member in my high school and actually gave the keynote for our graduation.  It was rewarding and required the skill tags you identified here.  These skills will continue to pay dividends as you head into your career.  I certainly used these skills when I worked for Hilton hotels.
167,"This is well written However I would just be careful of making sure you review and edit before you post I noticed you have a spelling error by \""""to enter so I have -T- be very good\"""""
168,Thanks for sharing your experience! The Arboretum is a great example of how community service can make an impact on society. I would suggest you find new ways to contribute to your community. Penn State offers opportunities at http://volunteer.psu.edu/. You can also find service organizations at http://clubs.psu.edu.
169,Thanks for sharing this experience! I see that you\'ve developed great skills from your experiences. I would suggest that you focus on one narrative to dive deeper into the story and reflect on that.
170,I think you did really well reflecting on the Shaver\'s Creek experience. You really encapsulated your leadership skill development well. I think that you should try joining other leadership groups activities or even an honor societies within Penn State to further increase your knowledge of leadership skills and how to be an even better leader! Here is the Penn State organization search to help find the organization that\'s perfect for you https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/hub/studentorgs/orgdirect
171,I would definitely add intercultural skills to your skill tags. I feel like you could further elaborate on this and really display your skills. However you did a great job describing the experience you had with the skill swap!
172,Great reflection Marissa. I\'m happy to hear you had a great experience at your retreat. Being a good leader also means being a good teammate. As Shannon said get involved with orgs on campus!
173,I agree with Helena! You seem have learned several things from this internship. Feel free to break up by project or event!
174,Great post Tram! I\'m glad to see you were able to learn a lot from this experience. \'Teamwork\' or \'Leadership\' are other skills you could tag on this post since the retreat aimed to help develop those skills. Nice work!
175,I suggest writing more about your experience your audience can really get the idea and see the development process or usage of your skills.  You should reflect on your experience at rotellis and what you learned.
176,I highly suggest elaborating more on how the movie pertained to you and your skill development. This will show recruiters the process of how you develop your skills.
177,Sounds wonderful . . . looks beautiful.
178,I think that we often forget that small steps can lead to a larger goal.  Kudos to you for starting a business that is supported by your community!
179,This is great to place in your portfolio.  It shows you are willing to take risks!
180,This is excellent!!! I would like to place my oder now for the holidays.  Do I order them at school?
181,You could add more here because these are such cool projects! :)
182,Way to go! I\'d love o buy a pie. :)
183,was this at PVEI?
184,This pie look delicious.  Do you deliver?
185,Just watch the camera footage the next day.
186,There was no better training for Administration than customer relations.  Nice job.  I need to work on my picture skills.
187,That was a wonderful event.  You guys did a great job making that night a positive experience for the kids.
188,Great details within your description...
189,Excellent initiative.  Are you planning to sell any at work soon?
190,How cute! What a nice way to spend community service hours helping a baby bird!
191,Maybe you could include how much money you raised.  What was your role?
192,Woohoo!
193,I love this description- the kids submitted many awesome pics for this event for yearbook.  It was an amazing team building activity.
194,Wow! This should be nominated for Principal of the Year.
195,Hooray for mental health!!  ;)
196,I have decided that if I make it to 2022 I will come visit.  Invited or not!!!!!!
197,How did going to camp next to a sublime ocean make you feel?
198,Great example of some soft skills and an experience that would be good interview discussion.  Just take another look at your last sentence.  It has at least one type and doesn\'t read quite right.
199,It would be great to make another entry/reflection on this class now that you are half-way through the course.  Would love to read about what you have learned about yourself and others!
200,Well done writing succinctly but in a meaningful way how you relate to these three different works and what they symbolize for you.
201,You should look in to our Maymester trip to Lyon France. It is a wonderful opportunity to explore both cuisine and culture and you could practice your French language and get some of those skills back (in a hurry I suspect.)
202,"Just a quick comment...we would say \""""learned\"""" not learnt.  Perhaps expand on the \""""field\"""" business knowledge you have gained as well particularly related to \""""soft skills\"""".  A separate entry on this with specific examples of experiences that helped you build these skills would expand a future employer\'s understanding of what you can do."
203,Good job of pulling together three descriptions of artworks and how they relate to your life.  Do proof read your entry again and correct the typos (or spelling/grammar) errors.  I think if you read carefully you will find them.
204,I don\'t know if there is a tag for perseverance but it so I would add it to this entry.
205,This is really cool once again another great opportunity to be involved in!  I suggest throwing in this post a specific situation you had that you overcame during this project.
206,I highly suggest further elaborating on your learning experience of R programming. Yet again another great thing to be involved in.
207,This is fantastic!!! As a fellow gamer I find it really impressive that you go out of your way to do things other women have not really stepped heavily into yet! This also shows a great deal of organization with the size of your group.
208,I would elaborate further on this experience to give the reader a better understanding of the exhibition and what was done pertaining to your skills.
209,These are nice reflections on your favorite paintings. I highly suggest creating another post that specifically reflects on your skill development based on one painting you connect the most with.
210,This was a very good and detailed summary of the movie. However rather than discussing details of the movie you should further reflect on your experiences and how the movie inspired you to develop these skills in the tags.
211,I am glad you enjoyed this experience! I highly suggest further reflecting on the experience by discussing the building of your skills in the skill tags and connecting it back to your summary of your experience.
212,This post was developed very well. I like that it showed your thought process on the exact flavors. Your style and tone of writing also helped to better tell the story to your audience.
213,This was a good summary of your experience. However I highly suggest specifically self-reflecting toward your skills used in the creation of bowls. You can show this by discussing your thought process with the audience.
214,This was a very good summary of the movie. However your post should be more focused on self-reflecting on the skills you used or developed based on the movie.
215,This was a good summary of the event and self-reflection on teamwork as a whole. However I highly suggest further elaborating on your experience personally in relation to your skills in the skill tags.
216,This was a great summary about the movie. However I highly suggest further elaborating on your self-reflection of the skills you either used or developed in result of this movie.
217,This was a very interesting grabber to start with. I highly suggest further self-reflecting on the movie experience to tie back to your development of the skills mentioned in the tags.
218,It is nice that you got to know your teammates better during this team building activity. I would continue this reflection by further explaining the experience tied back to your skills mentioned in the tags.
219,This was a good summary of the movie. However I highly suggest further self-reflection upon your developed or used skills from the tags and tie this back to the movie summary and experience.
220,This was a very good summary of the movie. However I highly suggest connecting this movie back to your experience based upon the ideals of the movie with developing your skills.
221,This was a nice summary of the experience you had at green bowl. However I highly suggest self-reflection further on the creation of the bowl your thought process and how this effected you your team
222,This was a good short summary of the green bowl experience. However I am not sure if you understand how to use these posts to your advantage. You should use this scenario as an opportunity to self-reflect on the skills you developed or used during this experience.
223,This is a good summary of the movie however I suggest using these posts as a tool to further frame your skills and how you can tie them back to a certain scenario in the movie.
224,So what is it about MakeSpace that made it worth it for you that helped you to develop these skills?
225,Good stuff
226,This is good! Your take away is stronger here but still consider expanding on it. Explain to me how your critical thinking in a hypothetical space situation could be applied here on earth!
227,This sounds like it was a good experience. You should further elaborate on this post to show the development and usage of your skills!
228,This was a great experience to write about.  This was a good stepping stone back story post for the more recent posts you have.
229,"Luke you are the living example of \""""alone we can do so little together we can do so much \"""" and that is amazing! Your behind the scenes contribution helped to make THON be the best it could be"
230,So glad to hear you found this engaging and are excited to explore further.  This was a first for my PSU14 sections so I\'m really glad it hit the mark for at least one student!
231,this was a good experience you had. However I highly suggest further explaining the skills you learned during this scenario. It will better help recruiters understand the way you develop and use skills.
232,I highly suggest futher building on this post by elaborating more thoroughly the development and usage of your skills.
233,Hey Wonsuk thanks for sharing! Your summary of the movie is strong but try to connect the events of the movie to yourself. Consider reflecting upon your major if you yourself have ever faced adversity and if so
234,This was a great summary of your experience however i highly suggest further elaborating on your actual use of your creativity skill tag or development of the skill.
235,This is great that you described the movie to the audience However it would be most effective to you if you further explained how you developed or used your community engagement skills.
236,What\'s up Jeffrey! Thanks for sharing your experience this is a great entry. Your takeaway here is really strong but I wold love to hear a little more background as to what you did at Green Bowl. Consider this when creating future Live It entries!
237,"Just one quick correction to make...\""""wedding party\'s\"""" is possessive.  You need to use the plural which would be \""""wedding parties.\""""  Good illustration of thinking on your feet and keeping good customer service in mind!"
238,What\'s up Jonathon! This is a great entry you not only shared your experience but reflected upon it as well. This is a great way to show your value in the classroom and workplace. Keep up the good work!
239,"The entry is good but consider unpacking it a little more. Give more background on the experience in order to explain how you came to conclude it would help to enable teamwork! Remember \""""reflective thinking turns experience into insight.\"""""
240,I would use this continuation to further explain your personal use of the skills.
241,Hey Jason this is a great entry! Not only did you summarize you experience but you reflected upon it and gave a great takeaway nice! If you haven\'t already
242,You\'re killing it Jason this entry is very strong as well. I really enjoy your playful writing style I can practically envision your confidence when creating the bowls. Kudos to you keep up the good work!
243,This looks like an awesome experience Ricky.  I would love to hear this better version of \'Super Bass\'.  I certainly don\'t have the talent to perform but respect the courage it took to get on stage and nail a song.  Congrats.
244,CAD is a super useful skill to have! It is great you voiced this technical skill in addition to your soft skills in this post!
245,This is a really great organization to get involved in. THON is recognized by many people everywhere you go helping people like this shows the heart and caring you have for people which is great in a workplace environment and life in itself.
246,All these experiences of leadership and community involvement are great! Keep up the good work!
247,This was a great summary of the movie. Howevr I highly suggest specifically showing how this movie helped you develop the skills rather than how Mark developed skills.
248,I really think that you should expand on this post based on your skills you put as the tags.
249,I highly suggest in the future tying back the movie contents to your personal skills learned and used based on the events in the movie.
250,I love that you are visits the arboretum with classmates. You showed all the skills that you listed above the entry. Great post
251,Nice I hope you did well in the competition! Consider strengthening this post by adding a takeaway or in other words a sentence to wrap up both your experience and your reflection!
252,What’s up Eclair thanks for sharing your experience! While your post is great you can strengthen it by not just summarizing but reflecting as well! By reflecting you’re giving potential recruiters insight into not just your skills
253,Very well said Vanna!  I can see your core values in action at each of our sessions and in my encounters with you at speaker luncheons.  Keep it up!
254,While this is true i’m not sure you’ve expressed how this pertains to you. Instead of just stating something you believe consider giving an example of a time you practiced this then reflect upon it to give further insight!
255,Cool I loved volunteering in high school too! This demonstrates valuable aspects about you both professionally and personally kudos! Consider getting involved with volunteer initiatives at Penn State if you haven’t already
256,It was such a pleasure meeting you & spending time with the rest of the WLI class!
257,"Kylyn as I read your reflections remind me of one the greatest leaders in sprituality and human justice said \""""the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.\"""" — Mahatma Gandhi."
258,This is exactly what we want in these posts. I learned a lot about your determination perseverance and desire to work with people. Continue to refine these traits and you will be successful in your time at PSU.
259,This campus has a lot of things to offer including an expansive history. Im happy that you were able to enjoy the museums and feed your curiosity. It is important to stay curious while studying at PSU because it will lead to finding out exactly what you want to do with your life.
260,This is great. Always lean on music because it is really good for stress management. Also I like how you tied it back to when you use to play an instrument in high school. It is important to keep music as a stress reliever because throughout your years at PSU you will have to deal with a lot of deadlines and assignments.
261,The arboretum is good for making someone nostalgic. These moments allow you see how far you have come and where you want to go. I suggest you continue going to the arboretum if its one of the only things that sparks this reflection because it is important for your development.
262,this is a great post. Life can fly by in the blink of an eye. Thats why I think you are on a good path by taking the time to go to arboretum and reflecting on life\'s events. This will allow you to see how far you have come and where you want to go.
263,I had John Water in undergrad he is a great teacher so i know you learned some great information. IT is very important to find a balance of studying long enough but not too much that you are unable to perform well on the exam. This advice will serve you well as the number of assignments you will have increase.
264,Privacy is very important thing to consider in this day of social media. Everyone knows everything about everyone which can lead people to paint a different picture of who they are to others. SO i think this talk was a great step in the right direction for the new generation to learn that privacy is a person\'s right that should be honored
265,That horse picture is exactly what college is like. Its an uphill battle but once you get to your destination you will be able to appreciate all of your hard work. I think you should continue visiting places like this that cause you to reflect on your like because it will allow you to see how far you have come.
266,Wow this is a great experience. Its different than most people and shows your desire to learn about medicine at a young age.
267,I love that you went to this event with 2 other classmates. In your classes is where you will develop relationships with people that will turn into your best friends. Also networking with others in the HHD college will serve you well for future class study groups.
268,Art is a beautiful thing that inspires nostalgia and reflection. I think this post is good because you are showing growth. You started off the story by saying you hated museums but now after this experience you have changed your mindset.
269,this post shows several skills that will serve you well in your future.
270,I believe it is great that you are holding on to the values and lessons your grandparents have taught you
271,as your mentor I can say post college is when I started really getting in tune to nutritional health and using vitamins. I also use calorie counting apps as a way to monitor nutrients intakes because it makes it a game to see how perfect I can plan my meals!
272,This sounds like a great exhilarating experience to have. This really shows your dedication to be involved even off-season.
273,This was a great class to be involved in. The vocabulary In this post shows your audience you really know what you\'re talking about with this project.
274,This is REALLY great that you stuck with something for this long so far! It really shows perseverance and dedication to what\'s important to you as far as careers.
275,Congratulations! That is an amazing thing to be proud of. Definitely keep involved in events such as these!
276,This was a very impressive way to describe a fraternity social chair. This post describes your position in the exact terms of professionalism people like to see.
277,That is very impressive you were able to raise the overall GPA. A lot of times GPAS will fluctuate substantially in college however this shows the dedication you had to being at the top and bringing everyone with you along the way. This is a huge factor in proper leadership.
278,This is an impressive internship to have! Keep up the good work and keep involved in experiences such as these that will propel you further into your field and prepare you for your career!
279,This is a really good event to experience to help you learn and grow throughout your time in college. Definitely keep these events in mind and attend them when you can they will really help you for your future and in helping decide what you may be happiest doing.
280,Helena this sounds like an amazing opportunity and experience.  No one knows more about what a work day looks like for a public servant like a \'receptionist\' for community issues.  Great work.
281,This post shows your attachment to perfection and doing things correctly. This is crucial in any work field and is great you showed this in your post!
282,Glad to hear that you gave it a little time in ME so you REALLY knew that it was not the right career path for you!  No looking back....only forward from here on out!
283,Nittany Lion Inn is a great place to start!  Next you will have the skills training and confidence to take a big step into cooking in a larger environment!
284,Being an example of good physical and mental health shows younger women everywhere that we CAN do it all.
285,Nice job filling out your overall profile.  This competition sounds pretty cool - good luck to you and your team!
286,THON is a great organization and I am glad you were able to share the experience with others. The longest I danced in the stands was 21 consecutive hours.
287,You have an insightful outlook. To ensure your health you need to make time for yourself. Below is an article I found helpful when I was building myself.http://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/how-to-find-time-for-yourself.html
288,Nice!
289,Great!

300,my reply
301,Great reflection!
302,lol
303,Thanks Kristine! And I do see myself having a management position in the future. I think one of my strongest assets is my ability to lead people.
304,I like your story Alex!
305,I really do!
306,I noticed that my other team members had no problem speaking with him so I picked one who would understand why I was asking this of her as well as willing to ask him to complete tasks. It was only a summer semester but if it had been longer I would have sat down with him to create a resolution
307,This is a comment
308,Is this comment under the pending tab?
309,Nice profile
310,Can you see this?
311,But you can't see this?
312,Hey this is a comment from 2/23
313,Thanks for adding your thoughts here Joanne.  How have our sessions at the school met or challenged your expectations?
314,Hi thank you for the comment. Are you the only one who are responsible to make comments?
315,That's a great quote!
316,This seems like it was a great experience. I encourage you to think about how debating someone in a professional manner can stretch across your career opportunities. It is a tough skill to master but allows you to grow professionally.
317,I love animals...what have you learned?
318,Which one are you?
319,@Catherine Hall - 4th from the left!
320,Nick this was awesome!  Thank you!
321,Very cool!
322,I like it  It's clean an it's ongoing
323,Very insightful!
324,Thank you for sharing this Kristine.  To be fair I'm not sure I've found myself at 33. Life especially when you are ambitious is a trial in learning and perseverance.  My family didn't understand why I chose to get a Masters degree or move around the country repairing broken school systems.  They saw the immediate need for me to be safe and secure.  What you are proposing is brave and 1 skill you will want is the ability to ask for help.  Not from a place of weakness but rather self-awareness. TY
325,Very interesting!
326,Thanks!
327,Dominic I am so happy to read your story and know why you like cars so much.  Always have curiosity on everything. Stay hungry stay foolish.
328,That was an awesome story Dominic! It's awesome to hear about how you could  connect with you grandfather.
329,Chloe I am glad that you find another interest. Having and learning more skills will do no harm to your future career.

332,I am so glad you enjoyed your time in Spain. Getting to experience another culture is a very fulfilling experience!
333,That's a great lesson to take away from your experience Chloe. We all need things that bring joy to ourselves. Keep up the good work!
334,France is a very beautiful place. I have been there a couple of times with my family. French is one of the  three languages i speak. I know you will have fun with your family.
335,Hey Barry its great to see that you got through your presentation. Confidence is key good job!
336,I am glad you are a part of the band. I look forward to hearing you perform. Let me know the date of your first performance
337,Autumn I am sure that you have done well in your swim competition no matter what place you got. Every one of you should learn that the most important thing in your life is not reputation nor prizes but friendship experience

474,Welcome to the team man. I come in every Monday Wednesday and Friday. Maybe I'll get to meet you one of those days.
475,This was interesting to read. Its good that you found your own path and motivation to get into your field.
476,I am in the same boat man. I literally just go to classes go to my internship and do homework. #SeniorYearStruggles
477,Dope story man sounds interesting and I'm sure you gained a lot from that experience.
478,Sounds like a cool experience you still might need a chiropractor though. #OldManBack
479,Sounds interesting man.
480,I like the story a lot man sounds interesting and I can relate. I worked a few construction jobs in the past where I felt inexperienced; I know that feeling of doubt going in. Cool Story man!
481,Great entry!!
482,sweet!
483,I agree Darrin. It was nice to see the kids working together.
484,Very interesting idea.
485,I think this needs to have an introduction so your audience a future employer or university has some background to your comment.  For example:  'Throughout my high school years I have taken several fine art courses like Drawing.  In my Drawing I course I ....
486,This is really good Good job!
487,I liked how you used a pink colored paper instead of just a plain white paper it makes the portrait stand out. ;P
488,Nice work!
489,You were very kind hearted as a kid. Its also cool you were on the news B)
490,Thanks for reading. Writing these entries for you viewers is the best.
491,Nice post
492,It is great that you are showing initiative! Keep up the good work.
493,In addition to this I'd like to recommend all readers to read more about the Celtic holiday we know as Halloween. The events that occurred and lead up to the one we know are all very interesting.
494,Cute characters. This drawing was well done. Each character has their own characteristics and the color palette you chose fit your art style perfectly.
495,Great choice. Calla Lily is a beautiful flower and so is the art work. Well Done.
496,They can be very inspiring
497,I just bought a new north face jacket. Hopefully it keeps me warm enough.
498,Yeah that was cool!
499,I agree!

502,I like the attention to detail of the eyebrows and the eye but the irises could have a bit more detail to make this image more realistic.
503,Thanks for the nice story. Keep them up!

505,Challenges that take time to complete really help you build patience which is a valuable trait to have.
506,No
507,If you go move at the speed of sound then you are moving at a super Sonic speed not 'lite/light' speed.
508,Interesting idea!
509,Great to see a self-starter! That's the sort of stuff we like to see in college or the workplace. Your initiative will accomplish great things. Keep up the good work!
510,Thanks for the feedback Mr. Day. I appreciate it!
511,hee
512,yes
513,Great post!
514,You're welcome!
515,Also I think a picture would be a fun addition that would bring your story to life!
516,Factssssss
517,I hope you were able to learn a lot about project management while being collaborative and results-driven!
518,Sounds exciting SJ! Enjoy your trips :) I hope you see a lot of new things and learn a lot more!
519,Glad to hear you're enjoying your college life a lot more after switching! What do you love about IST and how did you see yourself change in the past year of you switching?
520,Cute. I see what you did there. Great post!
521,Great aspirations! Keep on it!
522,Keep on it!
523,I think its great you want to work on skills that are learned and not measured like soft skills. Keep us updated on your progress.
524,I think that keeping timelines are important to keep projects on track. Good luck with handling obstacles!
525,That sounds like a really good goal this summer and it seems like this would be the perfect place to accomplish that.  I get the feel that here at Surge they will give you the help you need in order to start get going on your project.  I’m kind of curious to see how it will turn out.
526,I'm also double majoring in one of the business major and IST too and was totally able to relate to your reflection. I really like how you started with something you are good at then moving on to the next step with your passion.
527,can definitely relate to the feeling of not knowing what to do or major in when entering college. Double majoring seems like it would be difficult especially because it is IST and accounting. It seems like you have a really good grasp on it though! Finding something you enjoy like SQL seems like it helped a lot...I need to find something I enjoy like that for myself.
528,I see you definitely learn the environment and be a good coworker with others. Keep up the good work!
529,I agree with you that communication is very important in the full time work field. I am also trying to improve in that skill during this internship and plan on doing so by communicating with every intern as much as possible.
530,Building up my Communication skills is probably the skill I want to improve upon the most this summer too.  I agree that one skill that isn’t really taught in school is how to have good communication skills with a client.  So through this internship I’m hoping that I’ll be able to refine these same skills.
531,I agree that communication is a skill that individuals will need to work effectively in a group environment. Through this summer I also intend to work effectively in a team environment through communication. When giving an insight of what possible solution there are towards a project it is best to understand every individual idea and allow them to share it. I also look forward to working with you during the summer internship.
532,Word press seems interesting I think learning it along with wore frames will be very valuable. This team environment will also be good in helping achieve your other goals.
533,Hello! I hope you are able to complete this goal this summer. It is very important to have a voice in meetings and conversations and this skill plays a big roll in any professional fields.
534,Hi ! I agree that communication is one of the important skill to have in order to be successful in your team. I think this internship can really help you to be more engaged and also develop a better communication skills.
535,I agree that it is important to have a great communication skill others feedback are also the critical role to improve communication skill. I hope to have a great teamwork with you and improve goals together.
536,I like how you plan to take baby steps instead of trying to tackle it all at once.
537,I think you have really good goals and that you can accomplish them in this environment since we are all on the same level and have open minds to new ideas
538,I think those goals are very good to have. I too am going to try to learn WordPress and get a better understanding of its creation process.
539,I have not considered communication as part of the goals that I wanted to include as part of my summer goal. However reading your post has encouraged me to add communication as part of my summer goals as well.
540,I really like how you didn't give up after a rough year and you ended up bouncing back and excelling to where you are today.
541,I was in a similar place to you last year. I was content with my job and my course in life so I didn't worry too much but this year has really opened my eyes to professional business development that I never had the chance to experience before.
542,Sounds really interesting and like it was a great experience!
543,Your 2017 summer experience sounds so much interesting. Especially the world we live in such an adaptability to fast changes is greatly appreciated. In addition it's great that SURGE extends your experience with design as it is not direct interest of mine.
544,Hi Justin (Best friend :)) !! I'm so glad you found an internship for this summer and happy that we're working together. I hope that this internship teaches us many helpful things and help us to grow.
545,I'm glad that you found what you enjoy the most. Majority of people is not fortunate to go through such an experience. It indeed strikes them at their later stages of life. However I urge you to still keep exploring different fields of study as you might find even more fitting one.
546,Hi Manae!! Wow!!! Your story about joining a sorority and the experiences you gained from it sounds pretty amazing. I'm also in a fraternity that is also Asian-Interest so I can relate well to your experiences joining Greek life. From my own experiences in Greek life I've had the amazing opportunity to meet people from all over and learn leadership among other valuable skills.
547,Hope you enjoyed this comment BEST FRIEND
548,Hey Jeff I think you experiences learning and transitioning into a professional world are key to success. The transition isn't always as clear cut or as easy as we may think it is. Keep it up!
549,The internship in China sounds like it was also a good experience. That internship along with this year at Surge should help you build for your career.
550,That's really good to hear that you were able to manage working and attending Penn State while managing to achieve your goal of obtaining your desired GPA.
551,Around this time last year I was in the same boat as you while working at a local carwash. I'm happy that we have achieved our goals of obtaining an internship doing something we love.
552,Nothing wrong with making some money in the summer. Im glad to see you have developed professionally.
553,That sounds like an awesome opportunity.  You don’t see a lot of people who are in the IST major working for fashion design companies.  It also sounds like you got a lot of good experiences through this internship too.
554,Sounds like you are learning some professional skills!
555,Like you I once was not ready for the field I would be working in and this last year has really developed me professionally as well as within my field of study.
556,It's really good to know that you learned so many things and still trying hard to learn new things.
557,It is great that you realize what you are short on and now trying to learn and overcome your shortcomings.
558,Working in a design company in South Korea sounds like an amazing experience. It is great that you can incorporate the skills you learned in college to a business environment. Although I do not have any past experience I am hoping during this internship I will be able to apply the information I learned through my college experience to the work environment.
559,Sounds like a great experience!
560,Hey Alex I think your post is an accurate depiction of the escape room. I really enjoyed being on a team with you and shared in your competitive spirit.
561,Sounds like you are learning a lot! Keep on it.
562,Hi Manae! I'm a little confused on what projects you are referring to especially since we're all working on multiple ones. If you have any questions feel free to always reach out to Kristine team leads or head interns. P.S. Hi best friend!!!
563,Teamwork was definitely a huge factor in the escape room.
564,Hey Jeff I agree with your comments about how we work in a professional setting. Escape the Room provides a more situational view of how we interact and how we think.
565,That sounds like not only a really cool experience but also a really good learning experience too.
566,Very valid points. I think that communication is key!
567,Glad to have you! I find the environment to be very open and innovative.
568,I agree communication makes group work a lot easier. The teamwork aspect is a unique part of this internship and makes it more enjoyable than other internships may be.
569,Very good work!
570,That's great Subin! Communication is key in a team based environment and yields better teamwork and results.
571,Wow man very nice. It is great that you had experience in other fields other than tech!
572,:D
573,That sounds like a pretty cool volunteer experience.  I can imagine that being a Sunday school teacher could sometimes be frustrating it was probably pretty interesting though.
574,That’s definitely an interesting experience.  That had to be really difficult considering you guys didn’t speak the same language.  After this event did you ever learn more Czech?
575,Prototyping is great skill to have at hand as a project is only as valuable as the prototype that it set the precedent for.

577,Hello Michael
578,Hi Michelle.
579,WASSUP
580,Sounds like a process you don't want to mess up. I might need to call you for some help when I need to change my oil.
581,Great to hear your management of challenges. I had the same issue with figuring out clients' exact needs.
582,Wow! That seems like a tasking project to manage and on top of that having to get the audience to interact more.
583,Hello I'm not sure if I miss Puerto Rico but I would definitely like to go back to see how things are now because most of my memories are of when I was young so I cannot remember much. I do have some fond memories of Puerto Rico so I cannot say if I prefer the US or not. I do like the US a lot because there is a lot more diversity different cultures and opportunities than there would be  in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico was simple because I grew up around an area that was not very urban.
584,Have you ever experienced a strictly academic failure?
585,Alex Thank you for sharing your volunteer experiences.
586,Justin ;0;2019-01-02 18:47:32
587,Lacey How original and fun! Thank you for sharing.
588,Simon I often wondered why some peoples' results were spot on and others' were no where close to being correct. Hmmm...interesting?! Thanks for sharing.
589,"Simon Thank you for taking the time to give selflessly and for honestly participating in this volunteer """"activity""""."
590,Kristen Hmm...Those are interesting results. As many of your peers have mentioned and I agree we all posses traits and characteristics of each of the four houses.

623,Rachel Oh good. I'm glad!
624,Tevin I love that you mentioned breathing as a means of de-stressing. Although simple doing so is incredibly powerful. I shared this resource with another intern:  https://www.mindful.org/a-five-minute-breathing-meditation/

648,I hope you were not crushed by the VW scandal.  Maybe next time you can make a Chevy symbol.  :)
649,Both my daughters did a semester in England and I was able to visit each one of them.  I agree with you that travel opens a part of the mind that stays closed off unless it gets to experience different cultures.
650,Sounds like a fantastic cultural experience.  I have also visited Germany on several occasions.

862,"Hannah, thanks for sharing your experience! As you continue through adulthood, you will experience different types of leaders. It\'s always beneficial to  understand how different styles affect the team\'s morale and productivity. Consider taking leadership roles in multiple student orgs to gain new experiences.

866,"Being a woman in the engineering field is hard, eespecially when it is considered a male-dominate field.

You should take your experience with children from this post and further elaborate into another post. It seems like you were really happy with this position and it shows in your tone of writing."
867,THON seems like it has had a big impact in your life so far! I highly suggest writing a post on THON as a whole experience in addition to what you have done invidually with your groups. It is really impressive that you have done so much so far and are passionate with the things you do.

925,"You should look in to our Maymester trip to Lyon, France. It is a wonderful opportunity to explore both cuisine and culture and you could practice your French language and get some of those skills back (in a hurry, I suspect.)"
926,"I believe that the ability to identify with piece of art is what makes it so beautiful. Now that you have identified pieces of art that you can relate different events in your life to, you are more likely to be able reflect on the lessons you learned in those experiences. This is exactly what happened to you. Adaptability, self-awareness, and creativity are all great skills to have in order to be successful in life."
927,"I love the imagery that you are creating with your word choice in the beginning. As I read your post I feel like I am there. Your father\'s dedication to teaching you the sport of track seems like it has been huge in your development. I believe that teaches you a lot of lesson, including leadership, that will make you the best all around professional you can be."
928,"This is fantastic!!! As a fellow gamer, I find it really impressive that you go out of your way to do things other women have not really stepped heavily into yet! This also shows a great deal of organization with the size of your group."
929,This is nice that you admitted the mistake of incorrectly creating a bowl for your teammate. Also it shows that you had the drive and dedication to get back up and make another bowl they were dissatisfied with. This also shows emotional intelligence that you reacted to the dissatisfaction that you had noticed and acknowledged it.
930,This was a great experience to write about.  This was a good stepping stone back story post for the more recent posts you have.
931,"Luke, you are the living example of, \""""alone we can do so little, together we can do so much,\"""" and that is amazing! Your behind the scenes contribution helped to make THON be the best it could be, and for that reason, you make a great role model. Keep it up!"
932,"So glad to hear you found this engaging and are excited to explore further.  This was a first for my PSU14 sections, so I\'m really glad it hit the mark for at least one student!"
933,Interesting challenge and a good way to demonstrate your team building skills.
934,"What\'s up Jonathon! This is a great entry, you not only shared your experience, but reflected upon it as well. This is a great way to show your value in the classroom, and workplace. Keep up the good work!"
935,I would use this continuation to further explain your personal use of the skills.
936,"Regardless of the fact you refused to talk about work, at least you were able to connect and engage with your team through other topics. These types of events are imperative for strengthening group connections which in term strengthens the qualities of projects."

940,All these experiences of leadership and community involvement are great! Keep up the good work!
941,I really think that you should expand on this post based on your skills you put as the tags.
942,I am happy that you were able to get a better understanding of ethics. Ethics are very important to your success at PSU and in the corporate world. Also love how you end this post by saying that you arent perfect but you will make a cognitive effort to be as ethical as possible.
943,"This is a great lesson to learn early. Privacy is important when you are working in healthcare. In health care people are coming to you in their most vulnerable states, which means they expect you to keep all of their information. Also it is Important to respect privacy in healthcare because if you don\'t you could leave your organization open to huge fines.  "
944,I like how you were able to take this stroll down memory and connect all of your experiences to you current life at penn state. It is impressive that you were able to make the varsity team as a freshmen it shows that you are not only a gifted athlete but a hard worker. This experience shows that you have the ability and willingness to learn from your elders in order to improve your skills.
945,Great post. Privacy is so important especially if you want to work in health care. People come to healthcare facilities in their most vulnerable states so keeping what they share with you private is pertinent. Also there are a lot of regulation in healthcare that if you don\'t keep patient information private the organization can be subject to huge fines.
946,"First off I completely agree with you that the media has a huge impact on our lives. Especially with social media, we have become dependent on them for the newest trends and update us on the world news. Also I agree that our generation is hampered by this dependence on technology such as our cell phones. I think that this conversation will serve you well because it will make you more aware of this dependence and you can make a cognitive effort not to be. "
947,"I am happy that you were able to see yourself in so many pieces of art. This really shows you have a great understand of self awareness. I think if I saw that \""""application accepted\"""" picture i would have felt the same way. I think that you last quote is something that everyone should hear. College is an experience where you find out who you are. "
948,It is great that you got to do something that is atypical of your schedule. Music is a huge relaxer and i believe that it is one of the major things that kept me sane during my time at PSU. I suggest you continue to use music as a stress reliever.
949,"The beauty of PSU is something that will have many people in awe. I am happy you got to experience that. You seem to have the concept of \""""Self-awareness\"""" completely. "
950,That is what this event was all about. Being open to trying new things will be a reoccurring theme in your life a PSU. Allow this great experience to show you that you can have a great time doing some thing that you have never done before.
951,I love that you are visits the arboretum with classmates. You showed all the skills that you listed above the entry. Great post
952,"Cool, I\'m sure kids will love this! Keep us updated on how this pans out, I would love to read more of your entries. "
953,"Ah, so many of your entries are about contests, you’re leaving me hanging with the results! Not only are you a very creative person Joel, but a great thinker under pressure, which speaks volumes. Nice job!"
954,Very well said Vanna!  I can see your core values in action at each of our sessions and in my encounters with you at speaker luncheons.  Keep it up!
955,"One of my favorite cheesy sayings is, “a chain is only as strong as its’ weakest link.” You’ve definitely captivated this saying, and applied it to your roll as a leader, kudos! Self-awareness is a rare but important attribute, making you a valuable asset to any team or organization. This is awesome!"
956,"“A group becomes a team when each member is sure enough of themselves and their contribution to praise the skills of others,” is a cheesy quote I like to remember when it  comes to teamwork. You seem to not only understand this, but apply it to yourself, kudos to you! I would love to read more entries where you further explore who you are in team settings!"
957,"“Team work makes the dream work,” is a cheesy phrase I love to annoy my coworkers with! It’s great you recognize the value of working cohesively with a team, this is important both in and out of the classroom. Keep up the good work!"
958,"This is awesome Nikki, you did a nice job in both summarizing and reflecting. Your ability to channel what you learned in cheerleading to potential workplace scenarios gives great insight to potential recruiters. Kudos!"
959,It was such a pleasure meeting you & spending time with the rest of the WLI class!
960,"I think this is a great point to be aware of. I think many times our negative opinions of conflict effect our ability to deal with conflict. If we regard conflict as a way to have a positive outcome, all parties benefit. Great insights Abby!"
961,Hi Tori.  I admire that you gained new perspective on the art of failure here.  It\'s never easy to feel like you\'ve disappointed others or yourself.  It shows real leadership and growth when you can take those moments and learn from them.  I think that\'s when greatest growth occurs.
962,"Kylyn, as I read your reflections, remind me of one the greatest leaders in sprituality and human justice said \""""the best way to find yourself, is to lose yourself in the service of others.\"""" — Mahatma Gandhi. "
963,"It sounds like your brother is a wonderful role model! There are indeed numerous opportunities to be a part of PSU and pursue your passion. Here is the searchable directory of student organizations:https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/hub/studentorgs/orgdirectory/ And, of course, if we do not have a club of interest, you too, can start your one. Have you thought about joining one of the Spanish clubs on campus?  "
964,"Catie, this is a great experience to share.  Often company policies can get in the way of being human.  Great job reading past just the declined cards and asking your manager for assistance.  Kudos to your manager as well for giving that bit of space the person needed to catch up on their finances.  Great work!"
965,I love this post. I can especially emphasize with being dragged to places by a significant other. It can really take away from the beauty of a place. But I\'m happy that you went back and gained a new perspective. Great imagery in this post.
966,These are all PSU must stop place when someone visits state college. They all tell the magical story of PSU. I also like how you suggested people should visit Beaver Stadium on non-gamedays. This is important because for people that don\'t go to PSU they can sometimes only think of Penn State as a football community but there is much to it than that.
967,"This campus has a lot of things to offer, including an expansive history. Im happy that you were able to enjoy the museums and feed your curiosity. It is important to stay curious while studying at PSU because it will lead to finding out exactly what you want to do with your life. "
968,This is great. Always lean on music because it is really good for stress management. Also I like how you tied it back to when you use to play an instrument in high school. It is important to keep music as a stress reliever because throughout your years at PSU you will have to deal with a lot of deadlines and assignments.
969,this is a great post. Life can fly by in the blink of an eye. Thats why I think you are on a good path by taking the time to go to arboretum and reflecting on life\'s events. This will allow you to see how far you have come and where you want to go.
970,This is great. You are ahead of most freshmen by reaching out to alumni so early. Continue to do this because having a good network is very important at PSU and in the real world. Plus these conversations will help you learn exactly what you want to do with your life.
971,I had John Water in undergrad he is a great teacher so i know you learned some great information. IT is very important to find a balance of studying long enough but not too much that you are unable to perform well on the exam. This advice will serve you well as the number of assignments you will have increase.
972,Privacy is very important thing to consider in this day of social media. Everyone knows everything about everyone which can lead people to paint a different picture of who they are to others. SO i think this talk was a great step in the right direction for the new generation to learn that privacy is a person\'s right that should be honored
973,That horse picture is exactly what college is like. Its an uphill battle but once you get to your destination you will be able to appreciate all of your hard work. I think you should continue visiting places like this that cause you to reflect on your like because it will allow you to see how far you have come.
974,Wow this is a great experience. Its different than most people and shows your desire to learn about medicine at a young age.
975,I love that you went to this event with 2 other classmates. In your classes is where you will develop relationships with people that will turn into your best friends. Also networking with others in the HHD college will serve you well for future class study groups.
976,Art is a beautiful thing that inspires nostalgia and reflection. I think this post is good because you are showing growth. You started off the story by saying you hated museums but now after this experience you have changed your mindset.
977,this post shows several skills that will serve you well in your future.
978,Having that balance of transparency and privacy is very important. It will allow you to be successful in life. Continue to open up to people but only those that you can trust. You have definitely developed your critical thinking skills
979,"Kudos to you, I can’t stand running! Here, I would love to read specific examples of how you used teamwork, critical thinking and your physical abilities to place in the top two finishers!"
980,"Hey Andrew, thanks for sharing! Team work makes the dreamwork seems to be your motto here! Consider sharing about a specific time you worked with your team. Maybe you took up the leader roll, or proposed a solution to a problem! In not just summarizing, but reflecting, you allow for deeper insight into the way you think!"
981,"That is a long list of accomplishments, kudos! I would love to read more stories about your time spend working at the warehouse, it seems you’ve been there for quite a while. Keep up the good work!"
982,"Andrew, this is awesome! This is a great example of what can happen when you pursue something you’re passionate about. Keep up the good work!"
983,I believe it is great that you are holding on to the values and lessons your grandparents have taught you
984,Great example of community engagement. These are the types of things we like to see in this Live IT posts
985,This is REALLY great that you stuck with something for this long so far! It really shows perseverance and dedication to what\'s important to you as far as careers.
986,"This is also a great leadership experience, I would add this in your tags as well! "
987,This is a very impressive project to be involved in. I highly suggest joining and participating in more experiences like this either with clubs or on your own to keep up with what you\'re doing.

989,This was a very impressive way to describe a fraternity social chair. This post describes your position in the exact terms of professionalism people like to see.

991,This is a very impressive post. It really shows the knowledge you have of your field and of your projects. It is great you are working with the Navy as well! Thank You!

993,This is impressive you connected the experience back to your major and passions. I highly suggest further

1010,"I noticed that my other team members had no problem speaking with him, so I picked one who would understand why I was asking this of her, as well as willing to ask him to complete tasks. It was only a summer semester, but if it had been longer, I would have sat down with him to create a resolution, discussing where we go from there. I never found out the exact reason he did not want to listen to me, but I have hypothesized a few potential reasons, from him not taking """"orders"""" well, to myself, and not what I said to him, but how I said it. I have learned that I need to understand that tone can change the meaning of a conversation, and to create a open environment for critiques, even towards myself. "
1011,This is a comment
1012,Is this comment under the pending tab?

1022,Very insightful!
1023,"Thank you for sharing this Kristine.  To be fair, I'm not sure I've found myself at 33. Life, especially when you are ambitious, is a trial in learning and perseverance.  My family didn't understand why I chose to get a Masters degree or move around the country repairing broken school systems.  They saw the immediate need for me to be safe and secure.  What you are proposing is brave and 1 skill you will want is the ability to ask for help.  Not from a place of weakness but rather self-awareness. TY"
