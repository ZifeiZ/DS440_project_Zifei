1,Congratulations! You and your group sounded like you really worked hard for this. Sometimes long projects can cause a lot of stress. But with the right team you can achieve great things!

8,Both my daughters did a semester in England and I was able to visit each one of them.  I agree with you that travel opens a part of the mind that stays closed off unless it gets to experience different cultures.
9,Theory is nice and needed but isn't it always great to build something and see how it goes?  Also to realize the satisfaction.
10,Your dedication to this wonderful project demonstrates commitment and competence that will be valuable to employers. Your efforts to create beauty in the community will be enjoyed for many years to come!
11,Your reflection upon these experiences demonstrates competence that will be valuable to employers.
12,The skills learned from experiences like this will be applicable in many work situations.
13,Communication skills are vital in every profession and it's great that you recognize this. You might enjoy this article posted last year in Forbes on this topic:  http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregsatell/2015/02/06/why-communication-is-todays-most-important-skill/#5a6ac1873638
14,Your reflection upon this experience shows maturity that many never attain. Stepping outside your comfort zone opens the door to wonderful new life experiences.  Meeting new people who have different perspectives and backgrounds can help you become a more open-minded individual which is a valuable attribute that will help you succeed not just as an employee but in all aspects of your life.
15,Very nice to see initiative and follow through on a project that made a difference in the community. Well Done!
16,Great to see that you are part of a group which encourages an open discussion of ideas and learning about the perspectives / views of others. I would think this is a great learning experience and a terrific way to learn to work and understand how to work with diverse groups.
17,Great to see that you aren't afraid to take risks and welcome the opportunity to learn. Sounds like a memorable experience!
18,"Very nice to see that you are working to gain """"hands-on"""" experience. Learning the technical part is just as important as interacting with clients. Keep up the good work!"
19,its great to see you get excited about the racing but also about the technical and organizational skills that are required to make it happen.  Have you looked at the Formula SAE team as a way for experience?  its a great way to get your hands dirty get some experience with competition and is a real good gateway into the auto industry - including racing programs.
20,Christina: Your academics are impressive!  Beyond your GPA your being an Engineering Ambassador will serve you well.  It took me a LONG time to learn what you already must know that being that engineers who can communicates have far more value than those who cannot.  The EA program that Dr. Thole created is a shining example of communicating for engineering good so kudos to you for embracing that program.  Another beyond academic attribute that the Volvo Group supports is Women in Engrg.
21,Hi Jack Communication is one of the key elements to success in professional world. At Siemens we offer multiple development programs where you will be fully integrated into a team working to solve global problems. You will not only need to communicate with colleagues locally but in some cases around the world. Solid communication and teamwork is one of the key drivers to Siemens success.
22,Hi Christina Getting to know your teammates in a setting outside of work school or lab can be very beneficial. It builds stronger relationships and increases trust. At Siemens we have development programs which allow you to grow relationship professionally but also personally with the members of your cohort and with previous classes of your development program.
23,Leading by example is a great way to demonstrate leadership ability. Being passionate about the sport and being driven to do well allowed you to set a postive example for fellow team members to follow suit.
24,This sounds like such a wonderful experience in learning how to serve others. And this type of experience gives you a better understanding of what it means to be a business person who creates positive impacts in their community. I'm thinking how this experience plays into the idea of Corporate Social Responsibility for organizations and how you already have an idea of what it means for a company to be socially responsible.
25,Hands-on experience is often one of the best teachers. It shows initiative on your part to seek out an internship opportunity especially in a new environment (hotel) as well as trying to solve problems on your own before going to a manager. This experience of learning-through-doing seemed to be beneficial to you in your understanding of working with others who come from different backgrounds and perspectives.
26,Having the opportunity to participate in an event like this helps build your creative thinking skills as well as develop teamwork skills. You should definitely be proud of your work! The more you experience activities like this the more you'll be pushed to think in new ways build confidence in your presentation skills as well as expand your industry connections through networking.
27,In addition to knowing what you want to do knowing how to get there is just as as important. It's great that you have found something which you are so evidently passionate about. Having a plan to seek out educational and experiential opportunities like you've done will help you in reaching your goals.
28,I'm glad you had the opportunity to show others a part of your culture and you should feel proud of the work you put into this event. This experience shows you that we often need to be patient with ourselves and with our work. Though we live in a culture that is very much driven by 'busyness' and getting things done as quickly as possible your experience here shows that taking time putting forth effort and really trying produces a positive result.
29,I like that you didn't just say you gave a speech but said what it was about. A comparison to Finding Nemo! - sounds creative and like something you put time into!
30,Community involvement and volunteer opportunities are great things to be a part of. Taking time out of your own schedule to help others shows you care about individuals in your community.
31,Being able to influence others to create positive change is a wonderful skill to have. This shows you are able to organize events understand fundraising and care about the environment. Hopefully you'll be able to initiate these same skills and interests in your work environment to help your place of work consider their own impact on the environment.
32,As a fellow Zeta I'm always pleased to see ZTA continually being one of the top fundraising Greek organizations at Penn State. The opportunities to get involved in one's Greek organization are numerous and will serve you well in developing leadership roles and decision-making skills.
33,Seeking out experiences like this can lead you to areas of work that you hadn't considered before. Plus it is beneficial in building your networking connections. Being wiling to expand on your curiosity by actually trying or doing things will help guide you in your decision  making process in the future.
34,Seeking out opportunities like this allows you to engage in an area of work that you may not have seriously considered before. Plus trying new things and getting certifications like this can give you an edge over other individuals when looking for future internships or employment.
35,What positive thinking and action on your end! It can take courage to 'go against the flow' especially if you feel you are being treated differently due to gender race sexual orientation etc. Keep being empowered by who you are and you will continue to be a powerful example to the women you work with.
36,Being curious and seeking out connections with others will definitely work to your advantage. By experiencing new opportunities you may come across a part of the industry that you never considered working in. Keep making connections going on available trips and staying curious!
37,"Great reflection! It seemed like a nice opportunity to go on a hotel show. Maybe you can provide more details about the """"presentation skills"""" you mentioned in the skills tag."
38,One of the under-appreciated aspects of interning outside of your home town is that it can give you a better idea of where would be an ideal place to live after school. It sounds like you had a fantastic experience!
39,Excellent! You provided a lot of detail about how you started and run your club and I found your experiences quite interesting.
40,Nice detail. Your experiences that span years are great for talking points because they show the things that matter to you in addition to what you're good at.
41,Wow not only did you get to see the world but you did it while showcasing your talents! The conversations you have with people while abroad are a special chance to learn about other cultures.
42,Great experience! Try to elaborate more on your takeaways from this experience. You’re off to a great start.
43,It seems as though you learned about time management from this experience. Pay attention to one typo in this entry.
44,It seems you had fun in this experience and you learned a lot. Try to elaborate more on your takeaways and pay attention to the typos.
45,Excellent! You provided a lot of details and I found your experiences quite interesting.
46,Great reflection. It's great that you took something you are passionate about and made it something that could be shared with others.
47,I also started in ME. My reasons for switching were the same and I likewise now have an HR focus. It is relieving to be studying something that you know is a good fit especially after starting on a different path.
48,You could include some more detail but this does sound like a fun event to see through to its fruition.
49,Athletics definitely teach a lot of valuable life skills in addition to improving and maintaining good fitness. It sounds like you took even more away from cross country being a leader on your team.
50,It sounds like you learned a lot in this experience and in a gorgeous location. Good marketing relies on knowing your selling points and it helps to have your own experience backing those selling points.
51,This was amusing to read! Sometimes you have to serve customers who know the product better or at least have their own biases about it. At any rate I would recommend taking HM 411 Beverage Management if you expect to encounter similar scenarios in your future career.
52,It's cool that you can point to this experience and say that this is where your interest in hospitality sprang from. Taking time to reflect on experiences such as these is a good way to remind yourself of how you got where you are today.
53,Toronto is a cool city and it must have been especially fun to go there on a whim. That's the first step to it being an adventure is not knowing exactly what you'll be doing. Taking risks on your way definitely contributed to the value of this experience.
54,While I can assure you that you're not alone in enjoying running it's great that you found it to be something so enjoyable. Running is a great hobby for people who like to set goals for themselves and it will be all the more rewarding for you as you achieve them.
55,It's great that you have the initiative to bring something like your band to life. The logistics of organizing a band don't seem as fun as performing but your buckling down and doing them shows your passion for something you care about.
56,Having practical hands-on skills is something that sets you apart. So does the problem solving you need to use those skills. Great reflection!
57,A long term commitment to any activity is admirable. The volunteering experiences and skills you learned along the way are irreplaceable. Great reflection!

64,It is so cool that you've been a volunteer for Obama Campaign! Try to elaborate more on your takeaways from this experience.

66,Excellent reflection! I like how you elaborated your experience as a yearbook staff and that experience will definitely be helpful for your future career.
67,Great experience! Try to elaborate more on your takeaways from this experience. Also pay attention to few typos.

74,Excellent. Your provided a lot of detail and I found your experience quite interesting.
75,Great job try to elaborate more. Seems like a nice cultural experience!
76,Exploring and traveling will continue to teach you a lot about yourself as well as others. Don't stop exploring. Don't stop learning.
77,Making connections like this one are so important in the industry. By taking the initiative to apply for this position you have set yourself ahead of others who may have looked at the qualifications and not applied. You now have your 'foot in the door' by having networked and made a contact at the company. Keep taking the initiative and it will pay off!
78,What a unique experience in order to develop your problem solving and adaptability skills! This experience shows your leadership ability as well as taking initiative to make things happen.
79,Sometimes what seems like the scariest experiences can lead to the most rewarding ones! Being able to adapt to new situations is important and it sounds like you were able to make the most of your situation learn and grow!
80,What a unique experience to learn how to problem solve and be adaptable. This is a great example of showing how you work well with others especially under pressure!
81,Being able to 'see things from the other person's perspective' will help you go far in life - it also shows you are able to see more than one side/view to a situation.
82,Congratulations Kurt if you get a chance let us know how the launch goes.  What is the biggest challenge and how did you solve it?
83,Monica - it's great that you were able to recognize the importance of learning the strengths/skills of your teammates. In both the collegiate and (especially) the professional world it's essential that you are able to quickly and effectively identify the strengths/weaknesses with those you are working with - whether they be your employees peers or senior to you. Another key is to be able to leverage those insights into making good decisions about team structure communications
84,Jordan - time constraints are never fun! You get plenty of practice with individual time management in college but it was nice to see you being in a situation where you all were dependent on each other and had to use your communication and leadership skills to ensure you stayed on track. This is very representative of the working world where you almost always are depending on work from other to complete your tasks or someone is depending on you. Clear communication is crucial.
85,"Manuel - good insight about being assertive and owning the interview. You definitely want to be an active participant. Also remember that an interview is just as much about finding out whether the company is a good fit for YOU as it is them finding out if you'll be a good fit for that company. Be prepared do your """"homework"""" on the company and have meaningful intelligent questions that make your interviewer think. Doing so can help show how well you think"
86,This is a good story but doesn't seem to match the Community Service heading that I clicked on. So under the Community Service tab maybe you can use a different example that shows some community service you participated in.
87,I am happy that you now include travelling in your set of interests. Visiting new places and being curious about new cultures and people is an excellent asset for working in the hospitality field. Plus you can use your own travel experiences as a topic of conversation so as to better connect with guests and as an ice breaker in social situations to ask about the travel experiences of others. Travel on!!!
88,Keep up the good work with children as you volunteer for things in the future. You will always learn something just as you did in the story above.
89,Hi Monica! Your resume is looking good. May I recommend elaborating more on the skills you acquired during your internship? Tell me more about how you clarified internal medicine procedures. Describe your role in the treatment reviews. You may consider writing a story on your board about the internship and what skills you acquired to help organizations understand your skills sets more.
90,Hi Jordan you have a great GPA and have identified some good skills.  Companies would value seeing your resume if you post too.
91,Hi Nina your resume highlights a lot of exposure and skills from your internship - great job at sharing these details and keep up the great work with the dean's list! A recommendation for your resume is to capture any additional interests activities clubs or additional languages you speak.
92,Hi Manuel great job highlighting some of your key skills organization and interests. Consider adding your resume - companies would be interested in accessing your resume through this page.
93,We’re thrilled to see students like you taking initiative to improve engagement in your community. Check out this article that offers new ideas for improving engagement (http://www.example.com/article). We’ll stay in touch!
94,Grant - Good reflection. As you continue group work throughout the rest of your time at Penn State and in other endeavors consider the positives and negatives of strictly defined roles and goals. Can you think of an experience you have had where you were unable to step out of a defined role that limited you from experiences? Have you ever worked in a group that set goals that were too feasible to start with thereby limiting the groups potential?
95,Natalie - Great observations and connections with the activity and plans for SHO Time moving forward. You mentioned that you believe that trust is the most important skill when it comes to making a team effective. How do you feel trust is built effectively within a team? How does the trust you have among a team you work with for a project differ from the trust you have in your friends? Is there a certain level of trust that needs to be reached within a group? If so how is that level determined ;1;
96,Joe - Great job referencing your experiences in your first-year CAS class. You mentioned the organizational meeting your team had towards the end of the project in order to iron out key details that needed to be addressed in order to make progress. How do you create the same kind of pressure artificially 5 weeks before a project is due? What role does getting to know the people with whom you are working serve in that meeting? Would assigning roles too early be detrimental to the creativity of th
97,Sneha - Nice job referencing your experience in Engineering Design 100H. You mentioned how you were able get to know and understand the individuals within the group you worked with more over the course over the semester. However the main portion of SHO Time is much more condensed. How would you approach misunderstandings or conflicts between your mentees? How will you allow them the chance to get to learn more about one another.
98,Marisa - Thank you for sharing your previous experiences of working in groups. In SHO Time plenty of the work is delegated for the mentors. However there are certainly opportunities to go beyond what is asked of you. How will you balance your contributions to SHO Time while ensuring that you are allotting the appropriate amount of time to your group and to yourself?
99,Alex - Nice job focusing on our discussion of the unexpected issues arising during the course of SHO Time such as a student being unable to attend certain events. You mention that even if a scholar is unable to attend events SHO Time is important in that it helps foster inter-student relationships through substantial conversation. How would you ensure that for a student who for one reason or another is unable to attend certain events?
100,Alex - Nice job focusing on our discussion of the unexpected issues arising during the course of SHO Time such as a student being unable to attend certain events. You mention that even if a scholar is unable to attend events SHO Time is important in that it helps foster inter-student relationships through substantial conversation. How would you ensure that a student who for one reason or another is unable to attend certain events is still able to get the most out of SHO Time?
101,"Good reflection Alex! SHO Time features a lot of different events that different types of students tend to be more comfortable with. What will you do to make sure that all students gain the most of each event for their own personal growth? To what degree is it necessary to alter the """"plan"""" to aid certain students and to what degree is it necessary to try to push students outside their comfort zones?"
102,Thank you for participating so much in our group discussion. Your fresh comical insights kept our committee's time on Old Main Lawn fun and lively. Remember these observed interactions when SHO Time arrives this fall as many freshman will be nervous trying to impress others and gauge others investment levels in newfound relationships!
103,Thank you for sharing your Personal Mission Statement Tessa. It is clear that you are very motivated to have an impact on others and to give yourself the opportunity to grow and learn new things. As we move towards SHO Time consider what you will do to create an environment that lends itself for other students to be open about their goals and share their aspirations for their time at Penn State?
104,Natalie this was a very well-written post. I can see that you thought deeply on the topic of teamwork and its connections to SHO TIME. The few days of SHO TIME will be extremely busy and can definitely be stressful. Having strong teamwork prior to and during those days will be crucial to both the success of the events and to the enjoyment of the incoming students. I completely agree with you about trust. It really is an indispensable skill in any work setting or other life event.
105,Alex I really enjoyed how you provided a specific example where maintaining the relationship is key: when a mentee isn't able to make an event. It's very likely that can happen. Like you said SHO TIME is meant to foster the relationships among the incoming students. Having that dialogue with a student who may be unable to attend an event is crucial to developing the mentor-mentee relationship. We should all be aware of keeping such connections as they can really improve any students' time.
106,Alex I completely agree with your post. There are times when a student may not feel included in the activities for many reasons. You make a strong point: that being a Schreyer Scholar implies that you have what it takes to improve other lives. We all have what it takes. If for example an incoming student does seem to be shy I suggest we try and nudge them a little bit. We shouldn't push them too far out of their comfort zones
107,Joe I really enjoyed reading the specific experience you had with group interactions and teamwork. I could not agree more on the stress you place on effective communication and early defining of roles within groups. Having such in place won't be all that is necessary to succeed but they will surely set any group on the right foot. That's why we have so many meetings throughout the semester planning out the details for SHO TIME and making sure everyone is updated on each others' roles.
108,Joe I really enjoyed reading your observations on the HUB Lawn. We sure did see a lot of activities going on around us during our discussion. I recall you telling us about your experience with the CHEM 457 project. You mentioned how it was hard to get the project started due to the other members all being seniors with jobs already. I can definitely understand the struggle there. During SHO TIME I feel that we should all be mindful of getting planning done early to reduce any possible stress.
109,"Marisa it was a pleasure reading your previous experiences and how you learned from them. I can closely relate to how you felt when you were younger. Being a leader does not mean that you're constantly """"nice"""" to everyone. Sometimes like you said it is necessary to get your point across and be a bit more harsh. In SHO TIME most of the work should be delegated nicely but if it's necessary to do so"
110,Marissa that's a great observation! I really enjoyed how you structured your post and could not agree more with the common denominator you mentioned. People interacted with each other positively because they felt comfortable where they were. In SHO TIME as leaders we should all strive to do just that. Make sure everyone is comfortable wherever they are during the orientation. It'll be just like a HUB Lawn.
111,Grant great job relating key ideas with each other. Problem solving and teamwork revolves around every single moment of our lives and really is a crucial skill to possess anywhere. I like how related it to a personal experience - your research lab. During SHO TIME communication problem solving teamwork
112,Sneha I really enjoyed how you referenced your Engineering Design 100H course. I'm sure it must have been difficult for you and your team members to function together at such a different part of your lives - college. We should keep in mind that the incoming students for SHO TIME will be experiencing the exact same thing. They are all transitioning to a different stage of their lives and may be overridden with emotions. That and like you said being honest with others will help a great deal.
113,Tessa I really enjoyed reading about your passions and thoughts. I definitely agree with all your points on how creativity relationships learning and experiences are all critical components in life. All of those will help ensure we keep growing as people and evolve to adapt to certain situations. It's very similar to SHO TIME. During the few days of orientation
114,I'm so glad that you enjoyed our day Marisa!  It's really funny to see that as unique as we all are our status as Penn State students does give us that shared enjoyment of some pretty classic Penn State attractions.  I'll be interested to see how the group develops throughtout the summer and if the people you pegged as leaders and supporters early on stick to that role - I personally think you're all great leaders!
115,Ceci your post is making me miss State College more than I already do!  I definitely agree that with more time we could have made our day even more perfect.  I personally think it would be awesome if our group could get together another time and do some of those other things you mentioned (especially the Pokey Sticks!) but you're right- what you do isn't as important as who you do it with!
116,"I think it's so nice that you took the extra time to appreciate one more perfect aspect of the day: your perfect milkshake!  It really is those little things that can turn a good day into a perfect day and I don't think people stop to recognize those things as often as they should.  And like you said the weather is another one of those """"little things""""... I could definitely go for a beautiful day on Old Main lawn right now!"
117,I also finished my first visit to Penn State with a trip to the Creamery!  It really is incredible to think that it's been 3 years since that first visit and that this once strange place is now as familiar to me as my own hometown.  Funny that something as simple as ice cream can serve as a reminder of change hard work and the excitement and fulfillment that comes with growing up!
118,What an action packed day Jamie!  I think the inclusion of a Penn State sporting event is a really awesome choice because those events tend to exemplify some of Penn State's most central values like hard work perseverance and community.  Plus
119,You're definitely right Danielle that our perfect day was probably the break everyone was needing right before finals week.  I know that for me it's really important to take a step back from the stress of school and remind myself that there's more to life than work.  Thankfully
120,I think it's interesting that you repeatedly mention bonding as a team throughout your reflection.  While it's true that we went out of our way to visit some classic Penn State landmarks I think you're right that what's more important is that it gave us the opportunity to get to know everyone a little better.  I hope that everyone feels like our Perfect Day made us a stronger team that is ready to take on SHO TIME 2016!
121,Casey I think this mission statement is a great way to look at things. Focusing on developing skills outside the classroom is a very important part of college and it's important not to lose sight of that. A lot of fields look at the different experiences someone has when considering them for an internship and the like. I do want to warn you though that focusing solely on grades is a slippery slope. Focus on improving yourself and the good grades will come.
122,It's funny that something as simple as getting ice cream can be an opportunity for reflection (and that it can turn strangers into friends!).  As you mentioned the personalities of our group seem to blend well together which I think makes us an even stronger team.  Here's to hoping all of our decisions go so smoothly (and include more ice cream) once August comes!
123,I think one of the most important parts of this is the fact that you've figured out how to apply this mission statement to more than just your career or some form of professional development. One of the best ways to develop these sorts of mentalities like you're talking about is to live it (no pun intended). Sometimes the best way to make a difference is to just lend a hand and I can see that you're already great at that.
124,Spencer I really like your mission statement's overt goal to inspire and motivate others. I feel like that alone is something that we're looking for and hoping for in a SHOTIME mentor. I would like to see in one of these reflections a discussion on how you specifically are improving yourself. Have you been getting that coveted 4.0? Or are you just doing a little extra each day. Either one is commendable for its own reasons and I can't wait to see what you do.
125,Kokila I find it great that you're working on finding balance between our two goals of improving yourself and improving the world. I think these two goals tend to go hand in hand but being able to separate them and work individually is admirable. I think the idea of soul searching to find yourself is an important one to have and it's definitely one that should be shared with the SHOTIME students.
126,A cool part about your mission statement is that you want to keep for those who don't have the same experiences as you what others did for you. It's definitely the kind of skill set that we need in SHOTIME and maybe it's the sort of thing that we need in life. I'm sure the students who are under you will appreciate the guidance that you can offer.
127,It's great that you mention developing closer personal relationships. Many people forget how important that is to personal health. It's also an important skill in these pivotal years of school. Those sorts of relationships are exactly the type of thing that is important for SHOTIME mentors as we want to make sure the mentors and the students have a great relationship that they can rely on for the rest of their time at Penn State.
128,I think an important part of this is your focus on integrity and passion. I'm sure there's a fortune cookie somewhere that says if you combine those two anything can be done. but it's true. That's the type of determination that that can make dreams come true. I also like that you keep your goals open. You might not be 100% on what they are but you know you'll strive very hard at them.
129,Hey Akshil I really like this mission statement because you focus on not only your academic and professional developments but also your personal life. It's sometimes difficult to think about your personal life in your surely busy professional life but it will always be important to think about your family and friends.
130,Emily I really like that you're always trying to challenge yourself by filling your life with different activities. Learning to better yourself and also being aware of your accomplishments is very important. Keep doing what you're doing and I'm sure you'll go far in life!
131,"Gabby I really like your motivation in writing this personal mission statement. The fact that you are telling yourself that you """"will"""" succeed in accomplishing your goals is a sure sign that you are very passionate about your goals and accomplishments. I wish you the best in doing everything you can at Penn State and in the future!"
132,Kokila you're totally right that creating a mission statement is hard! I really like what you have set as your mission statement because it seems to encompass everything there is from personal to professional life. I personally think it's really important that you have a balance between your personal and professional lives and it's great that you are also trying to strike that balance.
133,Hey Raza I think it's really great that you look to your peers and other people. Using your mentors around you correctly is a very good skill to have and learning from these people will make sure that you similarly succeed!
134,Nicole it's really great that you want to help people overseas and it's even better that you're passionate about it! One of the most important things in life is to find something that you are truly passionate about because that way you can live your life in a way that's both meaningful to you and useful for the rest of society. Best wishes to your dreams of working in a global environment!
135,Spencer I really like your mission statement because it shows your own efforts in welcoming diversity in your life both ideologically and practically. Many people are not as open minded as you are so it's great to see someone making such an effort to improve themselves!
136,Madisyn I really like how you are putting a global perspective into your mission statement. Something like a mission trip can really change how we see the world and I can see that you definitely used your mission trip to South Africa as a source of your motivation!
137,Mike we all have something to bring to the table and it's great that you're recognizing your own skills to bring and using them to help the world as much as you can. Someone like you with the willingness to help people are important in society to help the world grow stronger!
138,Alex your mission statement is so simple and powerful. I definitely do agree about how people will try to avoid showing their passions and these people will find it hard to make it far in life simply because you need to be passionate about what you're doing to succeed in it. I wish you the best in pursuing your passions!
139,David I definitely agree with you that you should always lead by example and it's really great that you want to be that example for people to follow. Your mission statement shows that you're very motivated to improve yourself and I think that's a really good quality!
140,Kavya your focus on hard work on dedication shows me that you are a truly motivated individual. I'm glad that you are doing something that you are truly passionate about because a lot of people don't have that figured out yet.
141,It's so awesome to hear that you were able to go to a school that means so much to you and your family.  I often find myself feeling a little jealous of those students who come from a Penn State family because I think it really brings people closer when they are able to share that sense of community.  It can be a little tough to try to make outsiders understand how special some of the things that go on here are so I'm glad that you have people close to you who can appreciate it all with you!
142,"Great insight on the similarities and agreements of each mentor's """"perfect day!"""" The constancy made for a natural and enjoyable bonding experience. The planning stage might have been slightly more difficult had disagreements occurred but I'm sure the excellent leaders of the group would have found a compromise regardless."
143,Building relationships is most definitely important! I like how you mentioned the simple respect and kindness. Getting to know new people doesn't need to be a complicated experience. In fact even if you know nothing about a person simply starting with respect and kindness is the best way to get off on the right foot and build a strong network.
144,Great comment on the necessity to occasionally escape from the stress in the life of a student! Sometimes you just need to step back and enjoy the company of the people around you. Breaks from studying can actually improve your learning and improve your overall studying efficiency!
145,Sounds like an enjoyable day! It's easy to find common ground and make new friends with such classic Penn State activities. I'm sure you're able to reflect on the lessons you learned and the sense of community that you built on this perfect day.
146,Susan I really liked all of your selections and the insight that you put into each one of them. I especially liked the painting about the rocks: it can be hard to stand out but being confident yourself and not being afraid to be unique is crucial to developing yourself. Great job!
147,"Cara I really like the """"Modern Limits"""" painting and I think it perfectly captures the experience that a lot of us had when we first transitioned to Penn State. Being able to break down this large and complex experience into smaller parts is the only way we can manage it and I think it's great that you were able to recognize that and find a painting that matched that idea."
148,I love seeing both sides of this story(I read Sumit's earlier). I'm sure those communication skills will come in handy come SHO TIME! I'm excited for the Brain Show because I'm sure that the whip and nae-nae will make an appearance. Great work! Keep up the good posts!
149,I'm glad that you bonded a bit with your fellow mentors! A strong mentor network is imperative to the success of SHO TIME. I actually could use some snapchat tricks because I still have some of those hidden trophies left to get and I can't figure out how to achieve them. The dancing sounds interesting too! I definitely want to see it in the fall!
150,Teamwork makes the dream work! We can learn much from others especially those with knowledge and experience. SHO Time mentors should be like the veteran male cheerleaders you saw on Old Main teaching and showing the incoming freshman how to succeed at Penn State and beyond.
151,"I've been reading a lot of these mission statements and I'm glad that yours includes """"resilience."""" An important part of self development and discovering who you are is to work hard and be good regardless of what is happening in your life and it's great that you recognize that."
152,I notice that a lot of your mission statement overlaps with the ideals of the SHC which I think is fantastic. Either you had these ideals before and you found the best place possible to develop them or you have been inspired enough by them that you've taken them on yourself. If the latter is true then you'll be great at instilling those values to new students.
153,Passion is arguably the most important part of any mission statement. Regardless of the goals of integrity and of global perspective without passion there is no development made out of the  mission statement. I'm happy that you've identified that in your life as well.
154,"I like that your mission statement doesn't work in generics like """"I will develop."""" You've set goals (such as being challenged) and obviously by being a SHOTIME mentor you're working toward those challenges. I can't wait to see what these develop into."
155,I think the best part of this is that you're clearly doing your best now to make the world a better place. Obviously what you're studying can be developed into something incredible useful. But what's most important is that you live this mission statement in your day to day life with your interactions with friends and family.
156,I envy your ability to appreciate art! I unfortunately have trouble relating to artwork in the same way.  But we need people like you to continue the appreciation of art especially considering the emphasis on STEM fields and the subsequent pull away from the humanities. I noticed you are a chemical engineering major however and it seems like you have the perfect balance! Keep doing what you're doing.
157,"I really enjoyed the second painting you chose. I laughed a bit to myself because I've felt like that horse on more than one occasion. I feel like every day I find a challenge that I don't want to face - whether big or small. I watched a TED talk once (I can't remember what it was called) and something the woman said really stuck out to me: """"If you wait until you want to do something you're never going to do it."""" I try to remind myself that I have to create my own motivation."
158,Riley well done in your work to manage such a group.  You have an insight into what the moderators for the presidential debates are going through albeit they have 2 participants  compared to your 17. One huge skill you built through this was facilitation.  The ability to manage align and progress with a large group is something of value to any future endeavor.  Kudos and check out this link from Brown University for more thoughts on facilitation: http://bit.ly/1QkLIkd
159,"Good example of how you showed leadership in a situation when you weren\'t \""""appointed\"""" the leader.  It\'s these situations where you really need to use leadership skills to bring a group together to accomplish a task."
160,What a great learning experience and an excellent way to showcase both hard and soft skills you have developed.  I especially like that you were able to include a small collage photo of the event
161,It\'s great that you found a niche at Penn State after a rough start. Have you had any experiences in Gamma Sigma Sigma or in other clubs that are related to your major Athletic Training? You\'ll gain valuable skills in all your experiences at PSU and it\'s always good to find some experiences that are related to your major too.
162,Samantha- It\'s great that you want to join many clubs and organizations! It makes college more fun and you will build valuable connections like you describe below. Definitely update us on experiences you have had in addition to Sorority Recruitment now that the semester is in full swing!
163,"This is a great post that could use a little of tweaking with word choice. Other than that I like how you connected the nature in the arboretum to the story when you were 10yrs old. You chose the perfect soft skill of \""""curiosity\""""."
164,This is a great post about how you apply the things you learned in this event. I agree that social media has taken away from our privacy but it is how you let it is the key. Mediating how much you put on social media is a great skill to develop in order to promote the best Image of yourself. If there is any chance you can add more to this post i would put how this experience mode you specifically in a professional setting.
165,Hannah- I\'m glad you could learn so much in just one weekend! I believe that the best kind of leader is adaptable. In this case if nobody had stepped up to develop the plan would you have? However it\'s great that you recognized your natural leadership role. Here\'s my favorite article on the topic: it gives concrete actions to become a more well-rounded leader.  http://www.championshipcoachesnetwork.com/public/385.cfm
166,Your first sentence made my day- at Live It we\'re based on the power that reflection has to create personal change! I encourage you to post more entries reflecting on life experiences.  Have you thought about how leadership and reflection work together? The best leaders constantly seek improvement: using what they learn through reflection they alter their thoughts and behaviors to become more effective.
167,"Nicely written succinct explanation for all three of your choices. Think about how you might respond if an interviewer saw this and asked about your wanting to be the \""""best of the best\"""" but the job requires much collaborative teamwork. You are correct that you need to be at the top of your class to enter Athletic Training but you might need to think about and explain how you can achieve that and still be a great team player."
168,Zach this is a great post to show how you were able to tame multiple tasks at one time.  Your ability to partner with other individuals and agencies will certainly be a cornerstone for you in the finance field.  Do you see yourself continuing down the entrepreneurial path of building a brand via management or do you plan to push into a standard financial position?  Feel free to reach out via email dknicely@liveitu.com.
169,This is a great reflection on which pieces are of art you connected most with. However I suggest maybe just sticking with on piece of art per post It feels like you connect most with Peacock Blue and Yellow Seaform Set with Yellow Lip Wraps. To better your skills in critical thinking you can put yourself in a situation where it involves this skill. The best way to strengthen and further develop is by doing!
170,I can relate to you on this one You really hit the nail on the head. I think this post really encapsulates what you have learned as far as how to solve your attention span problem. I think you could further increase your conflict resolution skill by reading this article: http://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/conflict-resolution.html.
171,Wow you did a lot for your team!!! This is a great description of how you used and developed your leadership skills. To further strengthen your leadership skills I highly suggest participating in another sport at Penn State if you aren\'t already. If you get involved in any of the sports even if you are not a team captain you can still work on your leadership skills in a way that you seem to love!
172,Hi Cara! You will use teamwork almost everyday of your life and through this reflections you\'ve shown that you understood the importance of this skill. I would also recommend that you consider other skills that you have developed in the process. \'Risk Taking\' or \'Adaptability\' could also fit in this post as you described conquering your fear at a young age. Keep it up!
173,Great reflection Yoonsuk! The great thing about art is that any concept can be interpreted in several different ways especially when the viewers come from different backgrounds and perspectives. In the digital age more and more companies are hiring teams overseas to work together. Possessing intercultural skills is imperative in this generation to be able to communicate with people of other cultures. Keep it up!
174,It was interesting to see that you broke out of your shell that is definitely a step in the right direction! I would really like to see more posts about your developing leadership experiences. I highly suggest looking through Penn State\'s organizations to find one that best suits your hobbies and can help you develop your leadership skills. Here is the link to find organizations that will suit you! https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/hub/studentorgs/orgdirectory/search.aspx
175,Jill great reflection! As a past canner I too had learned so much from the experience. You can learn qualities about yourself when engaging with the community. If you\'re looking for new ways to get involved Penn State offers opportunities at http://volunteer.psu.edu/. You can also find service organizations at http://clubs.psu.edu. Keep it up!
176,Hi Elle thanks for sharing your experience. Unsure of how your leadership experience relates to the reflection. I would suggest you add a little more focus in your narrative and hone in on the skills you developed at that given moment. Other than that good work!
177,Thanks for sharing your experiences! Having a sense of self-awareness is very important. It leads to the development of emotional intelligence skills and can help you in your personal and work relationships throughout your life. Keep it up!
178,Great reflection Taylor! Leadership is one of the biggest most sought after qualities to have in a candidate. With leadership you can help others to be at the level of understanding you are. Keep doing what you are doing it will strengthen this skill in the long-run! If you\'re looking for more ways to get involved consider some of the orgs at PSU (clubs.psu.edu). Best of luck!
179,Hi Jeong great job on this reflection. I enjoyed that you and your team were able to discuss current issues. Being able to share your perspectives with others is very useful in a team setting. Thanks for sharing!
180,I\'m not entirely sure where this title comes in to play I would change it to better tell the short 4-word story summary of this post. I also LOVE your style of writing! Throw up the Creativity skill tag for this post. You did a really great job in really helping the reader envision the blueberry picking trip.
181,I would maybe even add the adaptability tag to this post. Reading this post shows me how you have adapted to the college life so much that you didn\'t have a thought in your mind about how it was until you were reminded. You\'re style of writing was also very engaging and enjoyable to read!
182,"I really like your extended use of vocabulary and the imagery you paint in your writing. However I do believe there is some parts of your post that seem unnecessary. Some of that space could\'ve been used to elaborate more on how this experience embodied the \""""Teamwork\"""" skill tag. I definitely would like to see more posts that further elaborate on your teamwork skills!"
183,So sorry to hear about your grandfather my condolences. Your post was written very well and I think it is really nice you used a personal picture to help support your writing! I am eager to see more posts in the future about your skill developments. If you are really into music if you are not already in a PSU music group I highly suggest joining one that best fits your interests. This will help you experience scenarios that will help you develop your skills further!
184,Great reflection Casey. Sharing your experience and perspective with others is a great skill to have in the work environment. And showing your patience and willingness to explain makes you a strong team member and leader. Nice job!
185,This is a really great story! It really embodies your intercultural Skills tag very well! To further develop these skills and learn even more I highly suggest joining a group in Penn State where you can connect and teach others about your culture. You could also learn from others as well.
186,Allowing people to share each other\'s ideas is critical in the work environment especially when trying to execute on a concept or new project. Startups deal with this on a daily basis. If you would like more experience with bringing ideas to life consider joining groups like Innoblue!
187,I would definitely add the intercultural skill tag for this post as well. If you want to learn Chinese and a little about the culture too I highly suggest joining BAOCP (Buddhist Association Of Centre Pennsylvania) in State College! They are really great people and you do some pretty fun stuff with them and its not a religion-specific group!
188,Thanks for sharing your experience! Dislocating your arm must not have been a fun memory. And that is very admirable of you mother to care for your grandmother. I suggest you dive deeper into how you see yourself as similar to your mother. Since this narrative is a reflective piece you want to look back on your own experiences.
189,I would definitely add intercultural skills in place of presentation skills. This seems like it was a great experience! I highly suggest participating in more experiences at PSU such as these to broaden your skills!
190,You did a great job at explaining your experience. Good job at using an original picture! It really compliments your writing well. I highly suggest further elaborating on your cross-country experience I feel like it would make for a great post on teamwork and leadership!
191,First off I would by lying if I didn\'t say this made me laugh hysterically. I would definitely add the skill tags interpersonal skills and intercultural skills to your tags. You did a great job writing this clearly for your readers to understand.
192,Katie this is a great reflection piece on a difficult decision.  My wife also was on the pre-med path and found the same thing (mainly because of organic chemistry).  She had to question her end outcome and got a minor in business. It worked out well as she landed a role as national marketing manager for a cable ad company.  Cheers to you on making the switch.  Also I have a close friend who works in HPA in Virginia if you want to connect with someone in the field. Email: dknicely@liveitu.com
193,It is great that you were able to connect to your inner values through this retreat. I highly suggest the ontinuation of this discovery by participating in other groups or activities in PSU or at home. You described your skills very well in this post!
194,Katie thanks for sharing your THON experience! You will use teamwork almost everyday of your life which is why the skill is important to develop. This post really encapsulates the idea of how you understood the importance of teamwork and used your skills to help your team. Good job!
195,Hannah thanks for sharing your experience! As you continue through adulthood you will experience different types of leaders. It\'s always beneficial to  understand how different styles affect the team\'s morale and productivity. Consider taking leadership roles in multiple student orgs to gain new experiences. Check out clubs.psu.edu. Great work!
196,Nice reflection Amy! As you continue through adulthood you will experience different types of leaders. It\'s always beneficial to  understand how different styles affect the team\'s morale and productivity. Consider taking leadership roles in multiple student orgs to gain new perspectives. Check out clubs.psu.edu. Great work!
197,Emily it\'s great to see how much you learned from this leadership retreat. Definitely agree with your last point of getting to know yourself your strengths and weaknesses. The best way to do this is to put yourself in situations where you\'re out of your comfort zone- you\'re guaranteed to learn about yourself. When something both scares and excites you you know you\'re on the right path! I hope you\'re involved in some of this kind of activity outside the classroom.
198,Great reflection Megan. I\'m happy to hear you had a great experience at your retreat. Being a good leader also means being a good teammate. And you\'ll see that throughout your college and professional career. As Shannon said get involved with orgs on campus!
199,Great reflection Emily! I would also suggest tagging the skills \'Self-Awareness\' and \'Teamwork\' to this post. I feel that these are skills you developed to complement your leadership skills. Good work!
200,Nice reflection Lauren! As you continue through adulthood you will experience different types of leaders. It\'s always beneficial to  understand how different styles affect the team\'s morale and productivity. Consider taking leadership roles in multiple student orgs to gain new perspectives. Check out clubs.psu.edu. Great work!
201,Great post Alexandrea! Retreats are a great way to rediscover yourself. If you\'re looking for more leader or teamwork activities find some orgs to join at clubs.psu.edu! Keep it up!
202,Victoria- I\'d love to hear the stories behind the different experiences you had at this great internship!  I see a lot of potential for more entries I\'m guessing here it was hard to fit everything into one here. Since you were exposed to so much variety consider writing a few entries that go in-depth by demonstrating how you learned these valuable skills.
203,Nice reflection Alexandra! As you continue through adulthood you will experience different types of leaders. It\'s always beneficial to  understand how different styles affect the team\'s morale and productivity. Consider taking leadership roles in multiple student orgs to gain new perspectives. Check out clubs.psu.edu. Great work!
204,It\'s awesome that you took the initiative to learn more about this problem as well as develop a way to educate others. Having done a weight-restricted sport in college and having a lot of athlete friends I know there is a need for education on this subject.  I definitely suggest reaching out to other PSU women\'s teams and staff who work on athletic nutrition counseling to keep this project moving forward. Consider getting others from your team involved as well- many hands make light work!
205,"Sounds like an enlightening experience! The hardest part about being a leader is still applying those three \""""pillars\"""" during tough times when your natural human reaction might be to do something different that is less effective or even damaging. Now that you understand the philosophy behind being a great leader how are you putting this into action? I\'d love to see another entry on a real life leadership experience and any surprises you encountered while implementing the above."
206,Agreed on your last point- great leaders help those around them reach their potential rather than focusing on \'leading.\'   I\'ll always remember being completely paralyzed with fear at one point during a similar high ropes course in college! I\'m glad you saw how that\'s an important lesson in emotional intelligence: in life there will always be stressful times that come out of nowhere. The faster you can recognize and address your negative emotions the better off you\'ll be.
207,Amy- it\'s great to see how much you learned from this leadership retreat. Definitely agree on the importance of getting to know yourself and your strengths and weaknesses. The best way to do this is to put yourself in situations where you\'re out of your comfort zone- you\'re guaranteed to learn about yourself. When something both scares and excites you you know you\'re on the right path! I hope you\'re involved in an activity outside the classroom where you can find this balance.
208,This seems like it was a very enlightening experience for you. I believe that you can use this same type of obersavtion in other scenarios to help you further refleect and work on developing skills through reflection. This was very well written and you asked yourself a lot of good questions!
209,I am not entirely sure if this post is about how you were accepted into the program  or if this was the process leading to it. I feel like you should take an experience what happened after this process and reflect on what you learned during one scenario within the group. Reflecting on an experience that happened with this group can help further develop your skills!
210,This is a GREAT position to write about and self-reflect on! You should pull from what you learned about your THON reflections on doing things for others. If you reflect on that very moment I believe it will make for a great post on what you are capable of in terms of your skills. Your writing style is very expressive and puts good imagery in the readers head!
211,Being a woman in the engineering field is hard eespecially when it is considered a male-dominate field. It is very important that you have this drive and passion for your degree especially in engineering! You should take your experience with children from this post and further elaborate into another post. It seems like you were really happy with this position and it shows in your tone of writing.
212,THON seems like it has had a big impact in your life so far! I highly suggest writing a post on THON as a whole experience in addition to what you have done invidually with your groups. It is really impressive that you have done so much so far and are passionate with the things you do.
213,I really like the connects and imagery you are creating! From reading this post your connection with your spirit painting shows your dedication and drive to plow through your struggles. I am not sure where the war belongs in the post though but I believe your self-reflection overviews what you have gone through and how you\'ve grown from it.
214,This is nice that you summurized the event so we could see how it looked from the groups perspective! However You should definitely show how this helped you and how you had benefitted from this experience as well!
215,This is nice to see that you have the communications skills to work with other people and discuss your future with other people! You are on the right track with the explanation of the development of your skills. Your leadership skills are also especially important.
216,Quite an interesting title! This post shows a lot of your teamwork interpersonall skills. I believe you are understanding the point of these posts and I highly suggest creating more posts to frame your personal skills!
217,Nicely thought through connections from your life experiences to the artwork you chose from the museum collection.  One way to improve a reflection is to give a specific example that supports how you feel about something.  Example:  What part or specific aspect of the St. Jerome painting represents your faith.  You did this well with the first two works of art and examples from your life.
218,Nice job writing concise but well supported reflections on three different pieces of art within a short paragraph.  You obviously gave some depth of thought to how you and your aspirations relate to these different pieces as well as telling a bit about the artwork.  That makes interesting reading!
219,Hey Liza this is awesome! It\'s great to hear about someone like you taking the role of a leader to help those who want it most. You determination not to give up in difficult situations is admirable. This experience is a wonderful example of leadership but I would love to hear more about how you feel it will help you in your future. Often times experiences we learn from resonate in our future decision making tell me about what this experience meant to you and how it will affect your future!
220,"Nikki - all of these are awesome skills to have that can be applied in many work settings! One of my favorite quotes is \""""sheer effort enables those with nothing to surpass those with privilege and position.” Try to expand on these skills; give specific examples of problem solving or acting out good work ethic to give a better idea of how you operate. These stories make for great potential future entries consider breaking down some of these learned skills into separate entries!"
221,What a great way to leave high school - on a high note! This story is great because it took so much work to get your to your ultimate goal of attending Nationals. Consider adding the teamwork tag to this as well since you reflected upon your team skills. Contemplate all it took to get you to finals; the hard work challenges and initiative are all aspects you integrated to ultimately reach your goal. The specifics of what challenges you faced can later be applied in other settings!
222,The Martian is one of my favorite movies! This is a fun way to reflect I would suggest going more in depth on how you would problem solve and how those skills would be valuable in the other places you mentioned! It seems what you learned about problem solving goes hand in hand with your takeaway don\'t be afraid to elaborate. What takeaways did you have how will these help you in the future?   Explain how Matt Damon’s antics in outer space relate to you here on earth with specific examples!
223,This is a great summary of the movie. However from this post I am not completely sure where you used your problem-solving and criticial thinking. I suggest either editing this post or creating a new one to showcase the skills you learned during this movie experience.
224,I think you  should include a picture of you painting It sounds really great and would compliment your post well! You described how you overcame your obstacles and frustrations very well this is a great post to showcase your skills to recruiters!
225,This was a great program to be involved in. Groups like these in college are great to develop skills for your future and yourself in general. I highly suggest creating another post that focuses on a scenario where you can further elaborate on your leadership skills.
226,"I like most about this post the sentence \""""We cannot be afraid of trying new things.\"""" I highly suggest making a post of a scenario you faced in an engineering course that you can also apply these risk-taking skills to. This will show recuiters more about how you are not afraid to try new things and step out of your comfort zone for the goodness of your team."
227,You did a really good job encapsulating the experience you and your team had at Green Bowl. I highly suggest creating another post that can help you better describe your skills in more detail. This post could be about any scenario you feel fit!
228,This post was written very well! It is great that you were able to elaborate on your experiences and specifically tell your reader the process of your project. Adding the picture was a good touch.
229,I like the explanation of the thought processs of your flavors at Sweet Frog. This shows the decision making skills you have and is desirable to recruiters to see this process.
230,I am glad to see you and your teammates are planning another live it experience! You did a great job explaining the skills you used during this experience. I do suggest in your next posts further explaining your specific skill development during the scenarios.
231,I’m glad you got to know your group partners while enjoying delicious food! I wold suggest expanding on what you learned how you executed it and why this matters to you. What takeaway did you have and how will it help you in the future? Breaking down the process of your night at Green Bowl will help to explain how these great skills resonate with you and can later be applied in other settings.
232,Hey Paul! You seemed to really enjoy The Martian which is awesome! It’s great you were able to observe so much going on in the movie but summarizing less and reflecting upon yourself more is a better use of the skill tags. Try to expand on these skills; give specific examples of how you would use ethical judgement or creativity to problem solve as opposed to telling me how Watney did it in the movie. Keep up the good work!
233,Devin - Green Bowl is a great place to try new foods! I’d love to hear more about your experience at the restaurant. Did you feel as though you tried something new did you learn anything surprising about your friends? Explain to me why you chose the creativity and intercultural tags here! A quote I try to remember is “a mind that is stretched by experience can never go back to its old dimensions.”
234,This is very intuitive! I’m glad you could find a piece of art that truly resonated with you. You’re right not may people do know what they want to do for the rest of their life and often times become overwhelmed in thinking about it. I hope you are involved in other activities outside of school your leadership and insight is inspiring. I would love to read more posts about you taking the role of a leader and helping others!
235,You hit the nail on the head! Teamwork is an important aspect in life not just the classroom or on the court. The cheesy saying “teamwork makes the dreamwork ” is something I tell my own group members all the time. Recognizing these traits paves the way for you to take initiative and be the leader I would love to see future entries of you reflecting upon taking a leadership role. Check out this TED Talk on teamwork when you get a chance! - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0_yKBitO8M
236,Hey William this is a really great and inspiring story. I would suggest adding the critical thinking and emotional intelligence tags to your post given you worked very hard to find what major you wanted to do and incorporated your families’ history of working in the railroad industry! Taking initiative to figure out what major you fit best and going to college
237,Joseph - this is a really great post! Your insight into why the activity matters outside of 2000 degrees is a great representation of communication and reflection. If you enjoy creative extracurriculars that pertain to your major consider joining the Penn State Robotics Club! Keep up the good work and remember “art without engineering is dreaming and engineering without art is calculating.”
238,Hey Jason! Green Bowl is a great place to step out of your comfort zone and break barriers. I’d love to hear more about your experience at the restaurant; did you learn anything surprising about your friends how do you feel being pushed out of a comfort zone was helpful? Elaborate more on why you chose your skill tags and how they are applicable in other places outside of Green Bowl. A quote I try to remember is “a mind that is stretched by experience can never go back to its old dimensions.”
239,Hey your summary on the movie is great but try to take what you learned from Mark Watney and apply it to yourself! For example try talking about a challenge you’ve faced and the solution you used to resolve it. You can do this by expanding on your feelings about communication issues you’ve faced in engineering
240,Andrew - this is an awesome entry! Explaining how you adapted in a tough situation shows leadership skills and flexibility. My only suggestion would be to add a takeaway; yes you learned a lot from this experience but what does that mean for situations off the mountain? I would also suggest getting involved with Penn States Skiing / Snowboarding clubs if you aren’t already - you would make a great instructor and team leader! Keep up the good work!
241,Hey Alicia! Thank you for sharing your experience i’m glad you had a good time! Here’s what I suggest; expand on how your experience at the show how will it resonate with you in other places? Did you learn something new or unexpected? How with this experience with your team help you in the classroom? Elaborating on these points will help to give a better understanding of how you plan to apply learned skills in different scenarios - such as the workplace!
242,Hey Suryan thanks for sharing your experience! Your insight into The Martian and its’ relation to the current state of the aerospace industry is very intuitive. Here’s what I suggest; take what you learned from The Martian and your knowledge on the aerospace industry and apply it to yourself. Take time to reflect upon how who you are and what you know will be an attribute to the work place. Elaborate on times you\'ve used critical thinking and conflict resolution!
243,Abdulla - thanks so much for sharing your experience at Green Bowl! I’d love to hear more about your experience at the restaurant; did you learn anything surprising about your friends why will this experience be valuable in the future? Elaborate more on why this experience was notable and how it will help you in other places outside of Green Bowl!
244,Hey I love your style of writing thanks for sharing your experience at Green Bowl! Here’s what I suggest; you did a great job linking the experience to skills that will be useful in many other places outside Green Bowl however try to reflect more on yourself and less on summarizing the event. Elaborate on how trust was established and conflicts were resolved to give a more well rounded view of the activity being an exercise in skill building!
245,Hey Kevin! Your writing is very strong thanks for sharing your experience! Here’s what I suggest; focus less on summarizing the event and more reflecting upon what this event taught you. Elaborate on how risk taking and teamwork will resonate with you in the future not just in Green Bowl. Don’t be afraid to focus on yourself explaining what you learned from this experience as opposed to summarizing it
246,Hey Ting! Thanks for sharing your experience with watching The Martian! Here’s what I suggest; you did a great job reflecting on how this movie relates to you however I would love to see you expand on your goals to become a great engineer. How do you plan to do this in what ways do you strive to make society a better place? Your takeaway from the movie was right on track elaborating on your last few points will just help to wrap it up nicely!
247,am glad to see you and your teammates are planning another live it experience! You did a great job explaining the skills you used during this experience. I do suggest in your next posts further explaining your specific skill development during the scenarios.
248,This is very important that you can master these skills and be able to also hold yourself to a standard as well as communicate with your team during dinners like these. In your future career dinners like these with both your team and clients will happen.
249,That sounds amazing! That is really a different experience to be apart of. I highly suggest creating a follow-up to this post after the competition to further elaborate your skills put to use during this incredible oppurtunity.
250,This was a good way to react to this movie! I highly suggest further elaborating on your skills learned during the movie. For example explaining the if factor of being in that situation what you and your team would do is a good place to start.
251,I love that you took the trip with Dr. Daley and some of you classmates. I like that you were able to develop all of these skills while building relationships with your teacher and classmates. Being able to have peace conversations about controversial topics is a great trait to have when you get into the real world. The traits you have developed in this experience will take you a long way in life. I suggest you keep developing these skills throughout your time at PSU.
252,i love that you were able to sit in the arboretum and reflect on key events in your life. It seems like the arboretum has that effect on everyone including myself. Also Self-awarness is a very important trait to have when you are dealing people from different backgrounds. It is the first step to being able to be empathetic.
253,I believe that the ability to identify with piece of art is what makes it so beautiful. Now that you have identified pieces of art that you can relate different events in your life to you are more likely to be able reflect on the lessons you learned in those experiences. This is exactly what happened to you. Adaptability self-awareness and creativity are all great skills to have in order to be successful in life.
254,I love the imagery that you are creating with your word choice in the beginning. As I read your post I feel like I am there. Your father\'s dedication to teaching you the sport of track seems like it has been huge in your development. I believe that teaches you a lot of lesson including leadership that will make you the best all around professional you can be.
255,Sarah - this is very cool giving back to your local community is a great way to get involved. I see you used the teamwork and community engagement tags expand on this! What did you do to personally to contribute did you run into any problems what was the process of raising money? Don’t be afraid to make yourself shine! Live It is all about student success
256,The arboretum has the breath taking effect on people. Its truly amazing and always brings back nostalgia. After reading your post I am very happy that you have an understanding of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is very important and it is a major key to success. Another skills I see that you developed was the ability to connect your past to the present. Thats a great skill to have because our past serves as point of reference for us to see the blessings we have in life.
257,Wow I\'m amazed. I was a Kinesiology major in my undergraduate and I didnt get a Personal training certification. So congrats to you. This shows you are goal driven and very cognizant of your future. That is a good trait that you should never lose. Kinesiology is a great major and while in it you will learn what you want to do for the rest of your life.
258,i agree that in the past there was a lot of masculinity and love of men. You are right to say that this is still relevant today. We have a long way to go for gender equality to be reached. This post definitely shows that you have a good understanding of self-awareness.
259,Great imagery at the beginning. Great story about the plant you mother gave you. We all have things that our parents or guardians have given us that we hold dearly. It shows a lot of responsibility to be able to take care of a plant. Also your story shows that you have the ability to juggle a lot of responsibilities at once.
260,This was written very well. This was a great experience to elaborate on. I highly suggest further creating posts such as this in similar tone and style with more like experiences. I feel like you would gain from joining a community club at Penn State. There are tons of clubs you could get involved in to further explore new experiences and develop new skills while helping people!
261,I am impressed by your writing!  Your title is engaging as well as your posts and you use transitions very well.  This experience was explained well too! I suggest creating another post showcasing a specific play you worked on and any obstacles you may have overcame.
262,Is this part of your major or a decision maker in your career process? If it is you should lightly touch on how it was your deciding factor. This shows the dedication you have to the field of work and the continuing dedication you will have.
263,A sport such as boxing is very good to be involved in. You learn about patience dedication and other skills that will help you later in life. I suggest making another post about an experience you had boxing where you specifically overcame obstacles.  This will show the development of your skills.
264,Were you involved in the project management aspect of this project?  If not what was your role?  I highly suggest including your role in this post.  Also I highly suggest creating another post that explains one major obstacle you faced during the project execution.
265,I like the touch of personality you put in your post worth the comment on the mini sized human.  It gives a true voice to your writing rather than it seeming robotic.  This is a very impressive experience to be involved in.  I highly suggest continuation in experiences groups and projects at this level.
266,Everything I have read about from you is impressive! This is especially amazing and makes you stand out because you have stepped into a male-dominant activity more than once.  This level of dedication and confidence sets you apart from other people!
267,That is really nice to hear you use the free resources Penn State offers. This shows your dedication to learn and stand out from the rest. You should tell of one issue you ran into and if you had attempted a mixture of the software and html at all.
268,It really is sad to graduate but this shows the moving on and beginning of the rest of your life!  I know this event has passed however if you can remember a specific time where you used any of your skills in the tags I would further explain these.
269,This is great that you put yourself in a situation where you could experience another culture! I highly suggest creating another post about any obstacles you may have faced along the way like language barriers or dialect differences.
270,I like the personable humor your out within your past it gave it personality and kept it engaging. However for the purpose of recruiters and keeping your portfolio professional I would take out the part about drinking.  I suggest making this post more about the skills you developed with the locals rather than the personal social experiences you had.
271,This is a great post. This is the tone and style you should follow when creating future posts. This displays your development of your tagged skills and shows your audience your dedication and leadership within your experience.
272,This is nice that you admitted the mistake of incorrectly creating a bowl for your teammate. Also it shows that you had the drive and dedication to get back up and make another bowl they were dissatisfied with. This also shows emotional intelligence that you reacted to the dissatisfaction that you had noticed and acknowledged it.
273,This was a nice summary of the experience you had watching this movie. However I do suggest you take this post a step further. You should think and self-reflect on how this movie inspired you to develop the skills necessary to take on a task like this in real life.
274,I really enjoy how you connected back the movie to real-life experiences. However I suggest further self-reflecting in this post how this movie pertained to you and your development of skills. Otherwise your style tone and transitions within your writing are all great!
275,This seems like it was a very enlightening experience for you. I really enjoyed the style and tone of your writing and the way you connected the game back to the skill tags. However I suggest in the future of your posts you spend more time focusing on how YOU developed these skills you saw in action.
276,This seems like you learned a lot about this workshop. Your style of writing really helps the reader to envision the experiments that were performed. However I highly suggest self-reflecting on how this experience helped YOU to develop skills. This will show recruiters how you use skills you have learned from other experiences in your everyday life.
277,What\'s up Kelsey! Thanks so much for sharing your experience I have a few suggestions that may help. Instead of giving so much background on the Inn itself talk more about yourself! I\'d love to hear about more of the things you did while working there as opposed details on the business. Your idea to put out coffee cake is quick thinking sharing more stories where you had good ideas wold be interesting to read about - keep up the good work!
278,Hey Shannon! This is a great post I also recommend expanding on some key points in other Live It entries. For example think about creating separate entries for your college and service industry experiences. You seemed to learn a lot form these experiences so they would make great material for future Live It entries!
279,Hey Shane thanks for your entry! I\'m glad you had a nice experience but consider telling me a little more about it. Elaborate on what you learned how it was a team bonding experience and why it would matter to a potential recruiter. Ask yourself questions such as; did any issues arise how did you contribute
280,Hey Kurt - this is awesome! Your writing is really strong but I would love to hear more about how you personally contributed. Expand more on a takeaway in other words what did you learn from this experience? Don\'t be afraid to make yourself stand out it sounds like this project took a lot of work!
281,What\'s up Jake this is a great conclusion. Consider expanding on this a little more by telling me how you specifically would communicate in an effort to problem solve. Relate all that happened to Mark Watney and his crew to your environment in a group work setting!
282,Hey Nicole thanks for sharing! I agree with Shannon your summary of the movie is really strong but tell me how it pertains to you! Instead of just summarizing reflect. Dig deep and try to relate to the problem solving in the movie. Expand on the skill by relating it to situations you\'ve handled
283,What\'s up Ian! This is a great post you portrayed your struggles with the assignment well. The only thing I would suggest is elaborating on your takeaway a bit more. The need to be versatile is a good conclusion but I would love to hear more about why you chose your major and how you ultimately figured out a way to paint it on pottery. Keep up the good work!
284,Hey Christina - this is a great observation! You did a good job not only engaging in the assignment and summarizing but reflecting as well. Your entry is great I would love to read more consider writing new entries to let Live It in on what you\'ve been up to lately!
285,What\'s up Michael I love your writing style! This is a great reflection of your activity the only thing I would suggest is expanding on your takeaway. Ask yourself questions such as; what did I learn how will this help me in other places such as the classroom or workplace etc.? Overall
286,Michael - this is great too! Your reflection represents what you learned very well. Again I would suggest expanding on your takeaway to give recruiters better insight into who you are and how you operate. Don\'t be afraid to make yourself shine Live It is all about student success! Talk about how you contributed what you learned and how you plan to use it in the future.
287,Hey David! It\'s really cool you dedicated your time to helping out fellow students. I agree with Shannon it seems you make a good leader I would love to hear about it! Consider writing another post where you discuss your leadership skills focusing heavily on yourself - don\'t be afraid to make yourself shine! Reflecting upon other scenarios where you were a leader will help to paint a better picture of who you are to recruiters.
288,This sounds like my kind of challenge! Your takeaway here is great you did a good job of not just summarizing the event but reflecting on what you learned and why it matters too. I would love to read more on your work as an engineer you ability to connect something as foreign as trying new foods to engineering shows you grasp the Live It challenges very well. Keep up the good work!
289,Hey Brain thanks for sharing! I\'m glad you had a great time and now feel comfortable with your teammates this post is a good summary and reflection. I would love to hear more about your experience working with them throughout the semester after participating in this challenge! Consider writing new Live It entries to give more insight into your skills and experiences keep up the good work!
290,This is so cool! You\'re right this is a great way to engage students and in a world full of textbooks and exams this exercise is fun and stands out! My only suggestion would be to expand on your takeaway here as well. I wold love to hear about how you personally contributed; were you a leader or an active team member who contributed equally? Overall this is a great entry!
291,Hey this is a good entry! You\'re right food is a great gateway to good conversation. I would love to see more entries where you expand more on your other skill sets! These entries can be about anything you want; food a movie an experience
292,What\'s up Jordan thanks for sharing! It\'s awesome you got to try something new while bonding with your team this is a good summary of the event. I would suggest expanding on your entry further by reflecting and adding a takeaway. Unpack what you did at Green Bowl and why it matters. Ask yourself; what did this experience teach you was it helpful
293,I love this movie! Very cool way to apply skill building. I would suggest expanding here too; consider telling me about a time you faced adversity just as Mark did! Perhaps it was at work in the classroom or in an organization. Your recognition of his great problem solving ability is great tell me how it applies to you!
294,What\'s up Jian this is a great summary of the movie it seems you really grasped what was going on. Here\'s what I suggest; take all you observed in this movie and apply it to you! Were you ever faced with adversity in any type of setting how did you handle it? Were you innovative like the NASA team or were you creative like Mark? Consider writing a new entry where you can discuss these skills
295,So glad to hear you say reflecting became a habit!  It is so very important to think about and reflect on what you are learning and your experiences so that you can first soak them in and second figure out how to improve in the future.  There is always room for growth and often you need to figure out how to make that happen for yourself!
296,I would further discuss any scenario or obstacle that may have happened during this event. Use that obstacle to your advantage by telling your audience and recuiters through the posts how you developed skills (or used them) during this time.
297,This was a good observation about not being botanist since it is a different approach that would be taken in the movie as opposed to real life with engineers. I highly suggest further expanding this post by creating another and further elaborating on the plan your team came up with in order to survive this situation.
298,Rather than saying which skills and why they would be useful during a situation like this you should relate the situation to a scenario you have faced before or will with your team in which you can use the skills from the tags you put with this post.
299,I would further expand on this post and elaborate on the development and usage of your skill tags rather than just a short explanation of each one. These posts if used effectively should be able to help you better explain you and your skills to future employers and recruiters.
300,What\'s up Luke you hit the nail on the head here. Your understanding of the movie is very strong but i\'m most impressed with your ability to relate it to you and your team. Kudos to you! I would love to see more entries by you given you have a great understanding of what Live It is here for - keep up the good work!
301,This is good! My only suggestion would be to give a little more background on the experience; explain how it built up to your takeaway. Tell me what you guys did in order to give a better understanding of your overall experience!
302,Hey Jordan thanks for sharing! Your entry here is great you not only summarized but reflected upon your experience too. I would love to hear more about your team and how you work together consider writing new Live It entries to go into more detail! Check out this short TED Talk on leadership when you get a chance - https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_wujec_build_a_tower?language=en
303,Hey Mengxiong thanks for sharing your experience! This is a great summary I could really picture what you were describing. My only suggestion would be to summarize just a little less and focus more on a takeaway. I would love to see you tell me a little more of what you were thinking during this experience and how what you learned will stick with you! Keep up the good work!
304,This is good! You seem to have grasped the deeper meaning of this exercise very well. I hope to read more entires by you soon maybe you could write about an experience from your home in China or an experience you\'ve had since coming to college. Either way i\'m looking forward to it!
305,Hey William this is a great first post! Your reflection on why this exercise will be useful in the classroom is exactly what Live It looks for. My only suggestion would be to expand on your takeaway a little more really unpack what you learned from this experience and how it will stick with you!
306,What\'s up Paul thanks for sharing! Your summary on the experience was great but consider adding a stronger takeaway. Ask yourself; what did you learn from this? Will it be useful in other settings? Do you feel your team will work better having done this together? Keep up the good work!
307,Paul - your summary of the movie is good but tell me how it pertains to you. Use Mark Watney\'s problem solving and critical thinking and relate it to yourself. Have you ever faced a complicated problem where you thought creatively? Do you feel you will ever have to being a mechanical engineering major? Connect the dots between you and Mark to paint a better picture of your thought process!
308,This was a great experience to get involved in. This experience was meant to help you experience dinners and events with your teams in the future of your careers. I highly suggest reflecting on this experience in a way that the recruiters can see the use and development of your skills and how they can you use you in their company.
309,The picture included was a really nice touch to bring your post to life! It takes a lot of skill bravery risk-taking and confidence to get out in front of a large audience of strangers. This is a GREAT trait to have. I would definitely add the risk-taking skill to your post tags!
310,Hey Khaled your post is great! I like how you summarized the movie to give a little background however I suggest relating this experience a little more to yourself. Tell how you feel this movie pertains to you as a mechanical engineering major! Take time to reflect; unpack your thoughts and ask if Mark Watney\'s antics in space can apply to you here on Earth!
311,What\'s up Ryan thanks for posting! Your summary here is great however I suggest reflecting more in order to enhance your entry. Consider taking what happened in the movie and relating it to yourself. Ask yourself how this movie set in space relates to you as a mechanical engineering major on Earth! Keep up the good work
312,Hey Matthew thanks for sharing your experience! Consider expanding on this; unpack what you did there and why it was important. What is Make Space why did you go there what types of resources were provided etc.? Giving background will help recruiters to get a well rounded view of not just the experience
313,This is awesome! Your ability to adapt and help others shows valuable assets recruiters look for. It\'s very cool of you to take time and teach a skill you\'ve mastered. My only suggestion would be to expand on your takeaway by including how you benefitted from this experience as well! Keep up the good work!
314,"This is a good entry but I would love to know more about the steps leading up to your takeaway. Consider unpacking the process of the dinner in order to give a better idea of who you are and how you operate! Remember \""""reflective thinking turns experience into insight.\"""""
315,"Hey Devin! Consider unpacking the process of the dinner in order to give a better idea of who you are and how you operate! Remember \""""reflective thinking turns experience into insight.\"""" Tell me about your dinner why you went there and what the experience means to you. Think of a takeaway that relates to the soft skills Live It encourages!"
316,This is a good entry your writing style is fun! Consider relating the movie more to yourself. Have you ever faced a complicated problem? Did you resolve it yourself or with the help of others? These questions will help you to reflect on the experience more as opposed to summarizing.
317,The stir-fry dinner is something that mimicks the types of dinners you will have in your future careers. It is important you voice your development of your skills during this event to show recruiters how these dinners work for you.
318,Team buildoing activities such as these are very important. it is imperative that you understand an effective way to work with your teammates and build stronger connection for a better work environment. It is great to get involved in these sort of activities.
319,This entry is good too but unpack it a little more. Give more background and a takeaway in order to paint a fuller picture! Will this lunch be beneficial to you in a setting outside of Green Bowl such as the classroom or workplace? Don\'t stop now keep up the good work!
320,Knowing you took into account an allergy this shows good communication skills and respect for your teammate Vince. This is very important in the future in careers and life in general. This types of dinners are great to be involved in for practice on how to effectively strengthen connections with your team.
321,This was a good connection from the artwork back to your life and decisions. It is espescially interesting and engaging to know that you had taken into account the story of your college decision. I highly suggest further elaborating on your intricate decision of your major choice in another post.
322,"Hey John this is a great entry. You killed it when it comes to not only summarizing the experience but reflecting upon it too. One of my favorite sayings is \""""reflective thinking turns experience into insight \"""" and that\'s just what you\'ve done here. Kudos to you"
323,I really like that you compared and contrasted your Live It experiences that\'s something I haven\'t seen before. My only suggestion here would be adding a takeaway; consider adding a sentence or two that summarizes your ultimate thoughts in order to tie the paragraph up nicely.
324,I wanted to let you know you do not need to highlight the skill tags within the post. You can solely explain the development or use through the personal story of your situation. This will help recruiters to better understand the way you work in your skill usage. However I highly do suggest speaking on your personal use of these skills rather than the movie\'s use.
325,I wouldn\'t particularly say this is presentation skills. aI would put this under risk-taking and initiative. I say this because you made a decision to try something new that you wouldn\'t normally do and took a risk doing something you have never done before. This shows the initiative you took to go out of your way to do something you are not entirely keen on but you still do it because it is something new.
326,Regardless of the fact you refused to talk about work at least you were able to connect and engage with your team through other topics. These types of events are imperative for strengthening group connections which in term strengthens the qualities of projects.
327,This was a great summary of the movie. However you should focus on how these skills applied to you rather than how the movie utilized them. It is good the movie at least sparked conversation with your teammates so you could futher strengthen the team bond.
328,Hey Drew! Thanks for sharing your experience your summary of the movie is great but I highly suggest reflecting more. In reflecting consider relating the movie more to yourself and your major as a mechanical engineer. Ask yourself if the challenges / skills Watney implemented in space such as teamwork critical thinking and initiative
329,Drew - this is a good entry. You gave background on the experience as well as reflected on what it meant to you! My only suggestion would be to unpack it a little more; tell me more of what you did at Green Bowl and how it is a good team building experience.
330,The reflection here is better! For this post I suggest unpacking the experience more. Tell me what you did at Green Bowl that lead to your feelings of a positive team bonding experience. In doing so you\'ll give potential recruiters better insight into how you think and work!
331,Paul - this is a good entry your summary is great and you had a takeaway that wrapped things up nicely! My only suggestion would be to cut down on details and add more reflection. Yes this experience was different than you\'re used to but why would that be valuable to a potential recruiter? Expand on this to give better insight!
332,Hey Kyle this is a good entry! My only suggestion would be to \'flip\' around the paragraph. Instead of writing your conclusion about the experience first consider writing it last as a takeaway. Summarize the event reflect upon what you learned then give a takeaway to tie up the paragraph. Your writing is great
333,William - this is a good entry! You gave a fun background of the assignment as well as had a strong takeaway that concludes your paragraph nicely. However I would suggest adding more reflection in between the two. For example consider giving insight as to why or what specifically made you feel this experience will be helpful when working with your teammates in the future! Keep up the good work!
334,Hey Zachary! Your writing is very strong I could picture the perfect day in vivid color! That being said consider taking more time to reflect as opposed to summarizing. Take your perfect day and apply it to the working world. Ask yourself; what about these skills would be seen as interesting or valuable to potential recruiters? Projecting your reflections onto the Live It platform allows for insight into how you think and work!
335,Hey Drew it took a lot to write this post thank you for sharing! Everyone at some point in their lives face adversity it\'s how you handle it that speaks about your character and you seemed to have handled it with true grace. I too very much look forward to reading future posts by you! Your writing is strong and you are able to conduct emotion throughout the paragraph
336,Hey Agustey! This is a cool idea it seems everyone learned a lot. Your background here is great but consider focusing on yourself more in future posts. For example i\'m glad you learned a lot about snapchat but i\'m much more interested in what you taught others
337,I love your title it\'s very creative. This is fun your writing is strong and descriptive I could almost feel the warm weather. I would love to read more entries by you where you expand on different experiences at Penn State given our environment usually shapes who we grow to be! Keep up the good work.
338,Hey Sumit! Way to not only summarize your experience in a fun way but reflect upon it too. Kudos! You\'ve got the Live It mindset of thinking down I would love to read future entries by you. Consider creating future entries pertaining to chemical engineering life at PSU or a club you\'re in / interested in. Keep up the good work!
339,Hey Natalie thanks for sharing your experience! This is a strong entry your reflection on the day is great. While this is a good entry don\'t be afraid to make yourself shine!  Consider focusing more on yourself and less on summarizing
340,Jack - while your descriptive writing is overwhelmingly vivid consider spending less time summarizing and more expanding on Leadership JumpStart. Ask yourself; what did you learn how will it apply in other places do you consider yourself a leader? Unpack what you learned from them / your own team. If you\'re having trouble linking blueberry island and Leadership JumpStart consider separating them into two different posts! Keep up the good work!
341,Hey Raza I love this idea! Consider expanding on your mission statement in separate Live It entries. For example contemplate times you\'ve helped others; are you part of a club that focuses on giving back have you taught others and learned unexpectedly from doing so? Unpacking your thought process allows for others to see into your line of thinking and in general
342,"This is great post. Huge improvement from the first post. I love when you say \""""college is an experience that continuously builds on itself like this art piece.\"""" This quote shows how aware you have become and you ability to apply this experience to your life. This post allows me to find out exactly who you are as a student and as a person. These are the posts that we want on Live IT. This displays all the soft skills that employers like."
343,The Arboretum has this magical way of making us think of our past and how it molded us. I think the best part of your post is when you speak on all the difficulties you have been through in life and how they have allowed you to grow. I urge you to continue to reflect on your experiences as a child and as a PSU student because with reflection comes the realization of skills.
344,This is a good post. I like how you speak on the fact that most people go through struggle in life and that in those tough times you learned some of life greatest lessons. You showed a lot of skills within this post and I know you will continue to develop these skills as you continue your journey at PSU.
345,"Great that you went to the museum with a classmate. Connecting you past work experience to this art work is exactly what Dr. Daley is looking for in these post. This allows you to connect a past job to skills that you can offer a future employer. Also your last observation of the \""""cradling wheat\"""" displays that you are an ambitious person which will serve you well at PSU."
346,I love that you had an open mind and did something out of your comfort zone. That is what college is all about Discovery. Music has a great way of making us nostalgic and calming us down. I task you with being open to different types of experience like music in order to discover new things about yourself because like i said before college is about discovery
347,I am happy that you were able to get a better understanding of ethics. Ethics are very important to your success at PSU and in the corporate world. Also love how you end this post by saying that you arent perfect but you will make a cognitive effort to be as ethical as possible.
348,I love that you are going outside of your comfort zone because this is something you will have to do throughout your college career. I like how you connected this experience to your future occupation. This shows you ability to be aware of your surroundings and how everything you do in college can be related to your future success.
349,This is a great lesson to learn early. Privacy is important when you are working in healthcare. In health care people are coming to you in their most vulnerable states which means they expect you to keep all of their information. Also it is Important to respect privacy in healthcare because if you don\'t you could leave your organization open to huge fines.
350,I like how you were able to take this stroll down memory and connect all of your experiences to you current life at penn state. It is impressive that you were able to make the varsity team as a freshmen it shows that you are not only a gifted athlete but a hard worker. This experience shows that you have the ability and willingness to learn from your elders in order to improve your skills.
351,Great post. Privacy is so important especially if you want to work in health care. People come to healthcare facilities in their most vulnerable states so keeping what they share with you private is pertinent. Also there are a lot of regulation in healthcare that if you don\'t keep patient information private the organization can be subject to huge fines.
352,"I am happy that you were able to see yourself in so many pieces of art. This really shows you have a great understand of self awareness. I think if I saw that \""""application accepted\"""" picture i would have felt the same way. I think that you last quote is something that everyone should hear. College is an experience where you find out who you are."
353,It is great that you got to do something that is atypical of your schedule. Music is a huge relaxer and i believe that it is one of the major things that kept me sane during my time at PSU. I suggest you continue to use music as a stress reliever.
354,"The beauty of PSU is something that will have many people in awe. I am happy you got to experience that. You seem to have the concept of \""""Self-awareness\"""" completely."
355,That is what this event was all about. Being open to trying new things will be a reoccurring theme in your life a PSU. Allow this great experience to show you that you can have a great time doing some thing that you have never done before.
356,Hey Brian thanks for sharing! I love your writing style it\'s fun and captivating You did a great job not only summarizing your experience but reflecting upon it too kudos! I would love to read more live it entries by you in the future
357,What’s up Joel this is very cool! I liked that you gave background on your experience for those who may not be up to speed on what a robot competition consists of. You also did great when it comes to not only summarizing but reflecting as well. Keep up the good work!
358,Joel I really love how your brain thinks in ways mine couldn\'t possibly fathom. Consider diversifying your Live It portfolio by writing about different topics. Perhaps your ability to speak multiple languages your life in the UK or your time spent playing frisbee! Soft skills come in many shapes and forms I would love to hear about yours!
359,Ah so many of your entries are about contests you’re leaving me hanging with the results! Not only are you a very creative person Joel but a great thinker under pressure which speaks volumes. Nice job!
360,Hey Nina I love the way you painted the picture of you painting pottery! Your writing is great and it seems your people skills are just as good. Interpersonal abilities are often extremely important when it comes to healthcare so kudos to you for shining in that aspect. I would love to read more entries by you soon keep up the good work!
361,Awesomeness in this post! What’s up Manuel thanks for sharing! I’m glad you had a good time at your dinner your post portrayed that very well. Consider writing more entries based around your daily experiences. Maybe something based around your ability to speak multiple languages or your love for a certain sport. Hope to read more posts soon!
362,Thanks for sharing your experience Jordan! You did a great job summarizing but I would love to see you reflect a little more upon your experience. Unpack it; don’t just write about what happened but dig deeper to connect this experience with who you are and how you work! Recruiters are interested in gaining a well rounded view of you reflecting upon yourself and experience will aid in doing that! Keep up the good work!
363,Hey Marco this is a great story that reflects the skills you’ve developed! Like Ricky said I too suggest diving more into the events of what happened in order to give a better representation of who you are! Explain what the events of the day you put together were and shift the focus from your childhood complication to your adulthood skill development. Keep up the good work!
364,One of my favorite cheesy sayings is “a chain is only as strong as its’ weakest link.” You’ve definitely captivated this saying and applied it to your roll as a leader kudos! Self-awareness is a rare but important attribute making you a valuable asset to any team or organization. This is awesome!
365,It takes a lot to not only recognize your weakness but take action to better yourself kudos to you for being able to do that! I like you ability to be humble it’s a very humanizing attribute that will appeal to many coworker and recruiters making you a valuable asset. I would love to read more of your entries in the future
366,“A group becomes a team when each member is sure enough of themselves and their contribution to praise the skills of others ” is a cheesy quote I like to remember when it  comes to teamwork. You seem to not only understand this but apply it to yourself kudos to you! I would love to read more entries where you further explore who you are in team settings!
367,Hey Grace this is a great observation. I love that you were able to look at a piece of art and apply not just meaning to it but meaning that resonates with you personally! I suggest adding the curiosity and critical thinking skill tags to this post given you reflected upon this piece to find deeper meaning. Keep up the good work!
368,While I love your line of thinking I do suggest adding a takeaway to strengthen your entry. Consider adding a takeaway to help wrap up your entry neatly as well as give the reader better insight into what you learned and concluded from your experience.
369,You are so right in that there is always room for improvement no one is perfect! I would love to read more about you experiences and less about specific skill tags! For example consider creating new entries where you tell more about a specific volunteer experience or a time you felt your teamwork skills were tested!
370,“Enjoy the little things in life one day you’ll look back and realize they were the big things ” is a cheesy quote I like to keep in mind! This is a nice outlook to have on life I suggest adding the adaptability and intercultural skills tags to this post!
371,These are all really good observations I would just love to see a takeaway to tie together this entry! You make many good points so it is easy to get lost in the details. Adding a takeaway will reiterate what is most important!
372,This gives good insight as to how you operate but consider giving less background and more reflection in future posts. By this I mean expand on how you operate what you would like to change and why. In doing so you will reflect upon your habits give insight to readers
373,This is a great post that gives insight as to who you are! Here’s what I suggest; add a takeaway to strengthen your entry. Adding a takeaway will not only wrap your paragraph up neatly but allow potential recruiters to understand what you got out of this experience and why it’s valuable!
374,Hey Emma! I love your writing style it’s very descriptive! This is a great entry you not only gave background on your experience but reflected upon it thereby giving insight as to who you are as a person. Kudos! Keep up the good work
375,Hey Weichen thanks for sharing! Here’s what I suggest; focus less on summarizing the event and more reflecting upon it. Instead of telling me details on the art pieces and your tour consider unpacking the experience and what it meant to you. Was there an art piece you felt related to you if so
376,While these are good attributes to have in the workplace I would love for you to convey how this experience applies to you through example. Instead of telling me what you value demonstrate it through experience via a story! Also be wary of the word limit in future posts!
377,This post is great in that it gives insight as to who you are and the life you lead. However I do suggest only including one art piece per post. It seems each piece resonated with you in a different way creating individual posts per piece will allow for you to elaborate on your thoughts and connections with the art in a more personal way through reflection!
378,Hey Maeve it seems your entry got cut off! Consider rewriting it in order to conclude your entry! While you’re at it consider taking out a few background details and emphasizing more on the experience itself through reflection. By this I mean as yourself questions such as; what did this teach me how will I use it in the future
379,All of your reflections as to why these paintings resonate with you personally are great but I would love more details. Consider breaking this post up into individual posts per art piece in order to elaborate more on how these paintings connect with you your soft skills and why!
380,I think this is a great point to be aware of. I think many times our negative opinions of conflict effect our ability to deal with conflict. If we regard conflict as a way to have a positive outcome all parties benefit. Great insights Abby!
381,Hi Tori.  I admire that you gained new perspective on the art of failure here.  It\'s never easy to feel like you\'ve disappointed others or yourself.  It shows real leadership and growth when you can take those moments and learn from them.  I think that\'s when greatest growth occurs.
382,Taylor wonderful to read you are taking advantage of the PSU alumni network! As you move forward on your journey I encourage you to continue to seek opportunities to network with others and craft experiences aligned with the skill sets required to be successful in the field. The PSU Student organizations offer several opportunities to do so.
383,It sounds like your brother is a wonderful role model! There are indeed numerous opportunities to be a part of PSU and pursue your passion. Here is the searchable directory of student organizations:https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/hub/studentorgs/orgdirectory/ And of course if we do not have a club of interest you too can start your one. Have you thought about joining one of the Spanish clubs on campus?
384,"I encourage you to continue to find time to reflect on experiences. It is a practice many great leaders embrace as it allows for both personal and professional growth. Ralph Waldo Emerson stated \""""Most of the shadows of life are caused by standing in our own sunshine.\"""" So find time in your busy life to step out of the shadows and reflect on a situation as often doing so lets the sunshine in!"
385,I aways love to hear stories where older students serve as role models! I also think it is important we share the impact those individuals have had in our lives at some point. So the question becomes what opportunities will you pursue to demonstrate leadership on campus? There are many student organizations available at https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/hub/studentorgs/orgdirectory/search.aspx Perhaps you can craft similar experiences here on campus?
386,So glad you were able to join us for the event! While I recognize the event may or may not be an event you would find yourself attending under normal circumstances it is important for us to continue to step our of our comfort zone and expose ourselves to different perspectives. Doing so allows us to grow both personally and professionally. So as you continue on your journey I encourage you to continue to seek and explore the many opportunities available to you at PSU. Well done!
387,Catie this is a great experience to share.  Often company policies can get in the way of being human.  Great job reading past just the declined cards and asking your manager for assistance.  Kudos to your manager as well for giving that bit of space the person needed to catch up on their finances.  Great work!
388,These are all PSU must stop place when someone visits state college. They all tell the magical story of PSU. I also like how you suggested people should visit Beaver Stadium on non-gamedays. This is important because for people that don\'t go to PSU they can sometimes only think of Penn State as a football community but there is much to it than that.
389,I love the imagery in this post. It also shows that you are reflective and have a history of being responsible. This will take you a long way at psu while you are transitioning from an immature high school student to an adult.
390,This is great. You are ahead of most freshmen by reaching out to alumni so early. Continue to do this because having a good network is very important at PSU and in the real world. Plus these conversations will help you learn exactly what you want to do with your life.
391,Having that balance of transparency and privacy is very important. It will allow you to be successful in life. Continue to open up to people but only those that you can trust. You have definitely developed your critical thinking skills
392,Hey Alexander thanks for sharing your story! Pledge Class Social Chair is huge responsibility congratulations! I like that you related specific skills to your position however I do suggest elaborating on them more in a narrative fashion. Instead of just saying you got ‘x’ position and learn ‘x’ skills
393,Very cool This is an awesome experience! Again I would suggest getting a bit more specific. Was there a time you faced adversity on the job or took up the leader position? Maybe there was a time you felt to be extra fulfilling; why what did you do? Reflect upon how you put your new learned skills into action!
394,Try to elaborate more on your statement “the skills I acquired were more experienced oriented ” as well as the different outcomes you felt occurred! In doing so you’re giving better insight into your thought process for potential recruiters. Try not to just summarize your experience but reflect
395,Hey Jason this is very cool. Here’s what I suggest; elaborate more on the process of designing the pedal tray. It seems you faced adversity when designing the break petal unpack the process of designing it then overcoming your obstacles! Try not to just summarize an experience but reflect upon it as well to get better insight into who you are
396,Wow that’s pretty impressive. Again I suggest here you elaborate on the process of repairing the car it must have been quite the ordeal! Don’t just say what you did explain it! Then
397,Kudos to you I can’t stand running! Here I would love to read specific examples of how you used teamwork critical thinking and your physical abilities to place in the top two finishers!
398,Hey Andrew thanks for sharing! Team work makes the dreamwork seems to be your motto here! Consider sharing about a specific time you worked with your team. Maybe you took up the leader roll or proposed a solution to a problem! In not just summarizing but reflecting you allow for deeper insight into the way you think!
399,That is a long list of accomplishments kudos! I would love to read more stories about your time spend working at the warehouse it seems you’ve been there for quite a while. Keep up the good work!
400,Very nice! Consider splitting this post up into two different entries; one where you share a story about an experience being an Academic Affairs Chairman and another where you share a story about your experience the Student Leadership conference in Orlando!
401,While this is a great story I’d like to know more! Dig deeper into this experience; do you feel it shaped you in your college major choice will it play a part in the type of job you want in the future? Consider giving specific examples of why you chose the problem solving and critical thinking skill tags!
402,Andrew this is awesome! This is a great example of what can happen when you pursue something you’re passionate about. Keep up the good work!
403,Being in a fraternity gives you access to many different extracurricular activities such as charity work. I suggest you take advantage of this because it will allow you to develop your skills and it shows employers you are more than just a student.
404,Great example of community engagement. These are the types of things we like to see in this Live IT posts
405,Hey Tomomi thanks for sharing! This is very cool it must have took a lot of dedication to get your chorus to the city finals. I suggest you take this post and either break it up or focus on one specific story. For example a specific story of a time you provided moral support
406,I love how involved you are! I think this post can be improved by focusing less on the minor details and reflecting more upon becoming president during what you described to be a difficult time. In doing so you’re no only telling recruiters how you stepped up but reflecting upon what you learned from that experience and how it has shaped you!
407,Hey Liam thanks for sharing. While it’s cool you had this experience I’m not exactly sure how it translates into your soft skill development. Consider summarizing less on the company and reflecting more upon what would be a better fit for you with a specific story. For example perhaps there was a class that had loose deadlines in which you didn’t do as well
408,This is an awesome entry great job! You not only summarized the event but reflected upon what it means to you and had a good takeaway kudos!
409,This entry is good too! My only suggestion would be to summarize a little less and focus more on yourself. I like that your take away concludes this was a reassuring experience but I would love to read a little more about why it was appealing to you and in general the types of jobs you\'re interested in!
410,Company culture is extremely important in terms of both an individual\'s success happiness and engagement; and the company\'s bottom line. I\'m glad the discussion centered around this! It\'s great that you\'re self-aware enough to understand that Qualtrics might not be the best fit for you even though the culture has it\'s pluses.   It\'s always a smart idea to learn everything you can about a company\'s culture before moving forward with them. I\'d suggest asking about it during interviews and looking at the reviews on Glassdoor.com.
411,"Alexander- excellent job articulating the valuable skills you\'re learning as social chair. Although I was my team\'s social chair in college I was not expecting to hear all the connections you\'ve made between this position and your future professional life. The kinds of interpersonal skills you describe will serve you well in any situation. Getting things done at work definitely is much easier when you know how to \""""play well with others.\"""" I encourage you to keep your skill development in mind and reflect on your actions (what went well what could have gone better) so that you can go from good to great!"
412,I really enjoy the fact that you interpreted your reflection differently in this event. It is great that you showed you are able to use the technology available to you to find someplace new. Your childhood reflection also was intriguing! Keep up the good work!
413,This is also a great leadership experience I would add this in your tags as well!
414,This is a very impressive project to be involved in. I highly suggest joining and participating in more experiences like this either with clubs or on your own to keep up with what you\'re doing.
415,This is impressive you were able to start a club based on both engineering and gardening. It would be nice to see more Posts about how this club is going
416,This was a good experience to get involved in. I highly suggest also posting about experiences you have had outside any prompts as well!
417,This is nice how you connected back from the movie instead of just summarizing it!
418,This event seemed like a great learning experience for you. I highly suggest further posting about more personal experiences you have had during your past few years that will help connect back to your skills.
419,The connection from the movie to real life in this post is very intriguing. I highly suggest getting involved in more activities alike this to post about and connect back to.
420,This is a pretty complicated thing to do if you are not 100% sure what to do. Within this short post you were able to tell your audience just a fraction of what you\'re capable of. Keep up the good work and keep sharing your experiences! :)
421,I\'m sorry to hear you got in an accident! However this is very impressive and helpful you were able to repair your own car. It shows the dedication and self-drive you have in your work and wanting to get things done yourself rather than rely on others for work needed. Aside from developing soft skills from this experience you have gained further knowledge in car repairs! I\'ll let you know when my car breaks down next! :)
422,This is a great organization to get involved with. This shows your generosity to help others without return and is an important skill to have as far as connecting back to emotional intelligence. You have shown a level of caring for the less fortunate that is highly praised throughout most people and companies worldwide. Keep up the good work and keep involved!
423,This was an interesting experience to write about. You were able to take a simple visit to friends in another university and pull your skills learned out of it. I applaud this post and hope to see others like it in the future!
424,You really made this post enjoyable to read. I love the way you formatted it into a story yet was still able to describe your soft skills learned through it. I have never experienced traditional Chinese medicine but it sounds very intriguing. I would say this post would not only showcase your skills but enlighten your audience on Chinese medicine and to further research it.
425,This is a very impressive post. It really shows the knowledge you have of your field and of your projects. It is great you are working with the Navy as well! Thank You!
426,This is a great experience to have. I highly suggest further creating more Posts like this with experiences you have had working with Navy research.
427,This is impressive you connected the experience back to your major and passions. I highly suggest further
428,This is impressive you connected the experience back to your major and passions. I highly suggest further immersing yourself in experiences such as these.
429,This is exactly how this prompt should have turned out. This post was done very well and really showcased the dedication genorosity and emotional intelligence you have. I highly suggest creating posts similar to this format and tone of which I believe works best for you in these posts in your future posts! Great job! Thank you to your brother for his service!!!
430,This is a great way to summarize this experience by connecting it back to your personal life and how it can help you!
431,This is an interesting story it sounds like however how did reading this book connect back to you and your experiences?
432,This is nice that you were made aware further of how social media affects our lives. It is also good that you were able to make a connection between how social media and technology affect us all now.
433,This is a good connection back to realize that social media indeed does not help but hinder face to face interpersonal social interactions.
434,This is a very impressive company to be involved with. I highly suggest further experiencing connections with company\'s such as Qualtrics to further propel yourself into your career with your field experiences.
435,I highly suggest writing a post further show the audience use of these new skills and how they helped you with a task! Great Job with the post!
436,That is quite a variety of jobs to have at once! This was a great summary of your member\'s father. I highly suggest creating another post to further elaborate on how his story influenced or helped you with skill development in situations or a certain situation. Good job!!
437,I am not entirely sure if this is something you yourself was involved in creating and organizing or if you are telling your audience this exists. This is a great event and is for a great cause! If you helped in the creation of this event I highly suggest creating another post describing how you helped. If not will benefit from this by making another post based on how it has changed your perception and helped you develop or use skills in conjunction with this event.
438,You\'re portfolio is very impressive! It is great to see that you are using Live It to its full potential and to your full advantage! Keep up the great posts and the involvement we really appreciate students like you! :)
439,That is incredibly impressive work! Research opportunities like these are incredibly important for a better understanding of your field and it is great you had this experience to propel you into your career.

441,TED talks are a great thing to put on a resume. Being involved with TEDx shows the level of  intelligence and understanding you have. I highly suggest further continuing with TED talks if possible! Great job!
442,This is a great short list however I would further elaborate on how these bulleted items helped you with your skills in a short few sentences.
443,This is a very interesting project. I would elaborate how this helped you with your skills in a current situation and why it was important for this project to be conducted.
444,You should further elaborate on how this affected your skill development for the skills tagged.
445,You should further elaborate on this experience after completing the semester on how it affected you. It would be interesting to hear the things you learned from this opportunity!
446,This was very interesting to read about.

450,That is very impressive this was a great step into the world of leadership experiences you will have from here on out. Keep up the good work!!!
451,Hey Ju-Yi thank you for sharing and an extra thank you for taking time to give us at Live It feedback! While this post is a good summary of all you did consider giving less background and focusing more on the issues you highlighted. How did you handle the group dynamic not being able to meet and over all how did you contribute? Reflect upon working in a group in order to make all you\'ve contributed stand out!
452,Riley - this is great! Way to think creatively when solving a problem for this reason I would consider adding the creativity tag to this post. My only suggestion here would be to highlight yourself more; how did you specifically contribute to this group dynamic? Keep up the good work!
453,Riley a special thank you is in order from us here at Live It! All you’ve done for us is of great value and you’ve done a good job displaying that in this entry. My only suggestion would be to expand more on how you engaged said individuals on a personal level. I think you’ll come to find this isn’t the first or last time you will have to use your own interpersonal skills to help someone else so I would love to hear more about how you put this into action during the focus group!
454,“Teamwork makes the dreamwork ” is a cheesy saying I like to remember when doing what can be difficult group projects. Dividing and conquering seems to have been your stagey here and it worked well! Consider strengthening your post by elaborating more on your takeaway; what exactly was the one conclusion or ultimately
455,Casey - while you did a great job summarizing your experience I would love to read more where you reflect upon how you personally contributed. It seems you’re saying each member played an important role consider expanding on what specifically you did! In doing so you will give potential recruiters better insight into who you are and how you work!
456,I’m glad it worked out! Here’s what I suggest: unpack the ideas of compromise managing time and helping others in a group more to give recruiters and idea of how you went about this. All of these are important accepts to understand both in and out of the classroom so elaborating on them is important! Use specific examples to help you in doing so.
457,This is a wonderful reflection kudos! You’ve done a great job of painting the picture of Old Main on 9/11. I love that this turned into an intercultural experience for you it just goes to show a lot can be learned from just a little conversation. Keep up the good work!
458,“A chain is only as strong as it’s weakest link ” is so true when it comes to working as a team. I’m glad this experience was ultimately a good learning experience for you as sometimes group projects can be disheartening. My only suggestion would be to highlight your contributions a little more don’t be afraid to make yourself shine!
459,This was a great realization to make and experience to write about. It really shows that failures just lead to learning. This post also shows your audience how you deal with failures and your dedication to try to make it work. Good job!
460,This is a very impressive project top be involved in especially since the project was also sent to KCF. I highly suggest immersing yourself in these opportunities when they come to continue strengthening your skills.
461,This is a very impressive use of multiple platforms to create a springbox. I highly suggest staying get active in projects such as these throughout your journey to continue to strengthen skills in your field.
462,This is a very interesting project and is very impressive to be involved in. Even though this was a small hypothetical experiment it still shows the level of involvement you have which is crucial for employers to see that dedication and perseverance in the future.
463,Eclair this is a great experience and what could be better as a Wahoo to keep a 5-year commitment to maintain engagement.  You can use Live It for this let us know if you want to try it.  Great work.
464,This is a GREAT demonstration of leadership!  And maturity !
465,I love that you found your passion of baking. A picture of what you decorated would add a personal touch.
466,"Hi Aziz your entry would benefit more from elaborating more on specific details. For example which organization did you interact with? Which was your favorite interaction and why? What in particular did you learn from them? Delve deeper and reflect on how \""""real life\"""" experiences differ from \""""college life\"""" experiences and reflect and talk about how you came to that realization."
467,"Aziz I see that you have used the \""""Risk Taking\"""" skill tab. I\'d love to hear more about what risks you took and how that helped you in your project. Your entry can also benefit from elaborating on your interactions with your classmates. For example I\'m sure working with people with diverse experiences and backgrounds from you might have helped you learn something new."
468,Brenna this is a great story! I loved learning about your passion and dedication for softball and basketball. I\'d like to read more about your thought process and what factors influenced you and what inner conflicts you had to overcome to arrive to your final decision.
469,"Brenna great story! I loved reading about your experience as a TA at iTech Academy. It sounds like you learned so much from working along side with kids as well as being a leader and guiding/managing them. I\'m sure you learned a lot about conflict-resolution in your experience as a TA and I\'d love to hear about it more in another post when you get a chance. I think that this experience could also benefit from the \""""curiosity\"""" skill tag."
470,Brian this is a very well written post! I enjoyed reading about your experience as a soccer referee. It sounds like you learned a lot about handling situations mitigating conflict and using your ethical judgment thus adding the conflict resolution and ethical judgement skill tags would make sense for this post. I\'d love to hear more about how you inspired your team to reach their potential and to aim by creating specific goals.
471,Ishaank I enjoyed reading about how you blossomed into a confident public speaker after taking this class. It must have been difficult for you to overcome your fear. As an introvert I faced the same problem at the beginning of my CAS 100 class but as I prepared more and got familiar with the material I learned to overcome my fear.  I\'d love to hear more about the steps you took to overcome public speaking. Do you have a favorite method of communication?
472,Ishaank I really enjoyed reading about your experience coding for the first time and to create a light weight Wikipedia search engine. I liked how you reflected and connected your curiosity with your past experience about following directions. Your ability to switch gears is very impressive and I\'m glad you were able to make that connection. What was the language you learned and what influenced you to study that particular language?
473,Jae it was a pleasure reading your entry about your experience as an international student. What a wonderful advantage it must be to have worked learned and befriend so many diverse people. I\'d love to hear about the similarities or difference of your experience as an international student at Penn State. For example in what ways is it similar or the same?
474,Matthew I enjoyed reading about your THON experience. The last line really resonated with my academic experience and my journey to finding the right career path. I\'d love to hear more about what in particular you are passionate about in your job as a member for the OPPerations Committee and what gets you excited about THON.
475,Hi Matthew thanks for sharing your experience. I think it\'s wonderful that you were exposed to such a great experience at a young age for 7 years. It really shows your commitment and passion for Karate and leadership. I\'d like to hear more about how your experience at the Leadership Team guided you through life in particular your time in college and life after graduation.
476,Jake what a wonderful story! It sounds like you learned a lot at such a young age and you probably didn\'t even know it then! I think it\'s very valuable that at just 13 years old you expanded upon different opportunities for to expand explore and succeed. As you continue to reflect on your experience as a rockstar
477,Jake it was exciting to read about your experience in your fraternity. It\'s wonderful how you reflected and acknowledged your responsibilities of being a leader and what managing 16 brothers would entail. Do you see yourself pursuing a career in management?
478,"Morgan I understand how difficult and frustrating it must have been to work with a teammate who didn\'t seem to be interested with working with you. This will often happen a lot in a professional setting and it can be tough to handle especially if you don\'t have a middle man. How did you know who to turn to as your \""""middle man\""""? And did you ever talk to him about the reason why he wouldn\'t communicate with you?"
479,"I think this is a great post Jackie!  I can\'t tell you the types of things I have seen some people post on social media that has caused them to speak to management at my job.  Be very careful on what you post and ensure that it is positive upbeat and not offensive.  And definitely keep your posts private rather than public.  I am so happy you had a session on this because social media etiquette is so important in this day and age.  I also think it looks bad when I see staff pulling up social media on the computer.  In my line of work I think it looks like \""""don\'t you have something else better to do?\""""  I also don\'t think it looks good if patients and families see hospital staff checking out Facebook or other social media sites so openly.  It just looks unprofessional.  If you feel compelled to check out social media"
480,Hi Morgan thanks for sharing your story about your experience at Cru. I think it\'s difficult to overcome the conflicts that we have within ourselves and to express/share them with people who might not understand where you\'re coming from. As you continue to face these challenges within yourself I do urge you to find the right people to turn to. Everyone has been there and you\'re not alone in feeling conflicted.
481,Josh great story! I can understand how frustrated you must have felt but I'm glad that you got through it. It's often easier and better to focus on how you should adapt to your environment and your teammates. It's also nice to see that you acknowledge your professor for what you've learned. Not many students give credit where it's due nor do they appreciate adversity in situations. I think it's great that you learned and grew from a frustrating situation- that's an invaluable experience that not many people take away from their time in college.
482,Josh thanks for sharing your story! It sounds like there's a conflict of interest within your group or within the entire class. If people cannot find the time to make it to a group meeting or pull their weight in a group project it sounds like they might not be interested in the course or that they are not passionate about Project Management. I'm glad that you got through it and understood the value of working together and priority setting.
483,Hi Ololade thank you for sharing your experience. You made a good point and observation about the impact of one's actions versus their intent. One's intent is meaningless unless they make an effort to show how dedicated and interested they are in learning about cultures. I'd like to hear more about your perspective on this as well as your thoughts about your own intent and actions. What did you learn about the actions/interests (or lack thereof) of others on the trip? How does that shape your appreciate and passion for other cultural understanding?
484,"My favorite quote is by Carl Jung and he says that """"Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves."""" This is a great story and a great example of how to overcome adversity in the workplace. Working on a project/organization that you're passionate about with people who work differently from your own style can be very challenging and difficult but I encourage you to think about how this situation would pay off in the long run and in your career. Although it might be difficult for you consider right now I think that you'll learn a lot about your strengths and have a great opportunity to work on your weaknesses when it comes to working with people who are different from you. The best part of experiencing a problem is the ability to work through it and learning from it."
485,"Hey Wesley I think it's great that you learned and realized what the power of being a leader entails. Teamwork collaboration and communication is very important in any industry but particularly in technology ultimately leading to innovation and impactful changes. I'd like to learn more about what made you come to this realization that teamwork is important and how your role as a leader """"diminished""""?"
486,Wesley I think you made a great decision and it sounds like you learned a lot from your experience. You made a great observation about how egos have no place in the workplace and that's true. It can be personally difficult and challenging to look past one's ego and to let others take the lead without being offended and it's very admirable of you to reflect and learn from this situation. As you grow and develop your skills I think it would be valuable for you to reflect upon your desire to be team leader in the first place and what made you change your mind.
487,Anthony it sounds like you've learned a lot during your time abroad in Russia. I'm glad you're able to capture your out of classroom experiences on this platform. I think it says a lot about your awareness if you can reflect about specific experiences about your summer abroad. I'm sure that you realized by now that your observations are very meaningful and valuable for you in the future to allow reflect upon your interactions with a diverse group of people in different perspectives.
488,Anthony thanks for sharing your experience about your mission trip. Similar to your entry about your study abroad experience it's important to take a step back and reflect upon your interactions and experiences with people who come from different backgrounds. I think one major take away from your diverse experiences is to be able to take a step back and meet your audience with empathy and self-awareness so you can effectively get through to them with your perspective and to influence them with your passions and interests.
489,Morgan thanks for sharing your post. It's great that you're realizing the importance of dialogue and perspective. I think it's wonderful that you're able to take a step back from your own views and perspectives to learn about others and to discover more about yourself and your interests. It also sounds like you're taking healthy risks and are keeping yourself informed about different cultures that are different from what you're familiar with.
490,Well said. An added value is that when you write a reflection peers can communicate with each other on that specific reflection or summary.  Thanks!
491,"Devin good job so far. Remember to capitalize your'""""I's."
492,Fix the area with the random period.
493,Hello Markia! I am happy to hear that you were able to get so much out of this trip not only academically but also for yourself. Emotional intelligence is very hard to understand and many people go through life without understanding it. Yet the fact that you were able to experience it
494,Hey Matt thanks for sharing. You make a good point about how challenges and hardships can shape you to be more resilient in the end. Life presents often presents you with different opportunities to learn about yourself and they often come as challenges that you've never faced. These challenges allow you to learn about yourself like how do you overcome them? View them as opportunities to improve yourself
495,Hey Emir! Welcome to the Surge family. I'm so glad to hear that you're adapting so well to your new internship! My role is to support you in ways that will help you develop and grow. My goal is to also foster that type of environment so you're able to collaborate with others with different skill sets and interests. Never hesitate to reach out to me with any questions help or feedback! :)
496,Hi Paulette! Thanks for stepping up to be the lead intern--it shows that you have a lot of initiative and that you are looking to challenge yourself in new ways. Way to go! When you led the meeting 2 weeks ago and last week I thought you did a great job being confident! I know that this role takes time to get used to but I know that from your work and attitude you'll be a great leader and supporter.
497,I think deciding to volunteer to help the homeless is great!  I wish you the best of luck in the future
498,Going in depth on which courses you have also taken definitely made it more appealing to those looking to see the experience you have in the arts. It sounds very educated and the diction definitely portrays your early professionalism in what you do and how you can analyze yourself.
499,Hey Abigail! My name is Andrew I work with Kristine who visited your class recently. Great piece of work! For only your second time using pastels it looks fantastic. You've done a great job identifying the soft skills you learned/experienced through this. These are so important to recognize throughout your life as they aren't discussed in academia. Even though it was a tough drawing you've done great and don't stop!
500,Hey Hailey! My name is Andrew I work with Kristine who visited your class recently. Your mission trip sounds really gratifying and an awesome experience! It seems like you've taken some quality time reflecting on this experience and identifying what you gained from it. Keep it up!
501,It was very interesting to read your entry. I am happy to hear that although it took you a lot of time to complete the assignment you found it helpful you found value in the experience. Being patient is definitely a virtue that is great to develop early in your career because you will be using it a lot throughout the year. Great job. And your piece is beautiful!
502,Hey David great story. Not only did you exemplify great communication skills but it also sounds like you developed showed problem solving and teamwork. You managed to get on the same page with your co-captain and strive to work together to get on the same schedule to achieve the same goal. The skills you talk about here are traits every business needs to succeed.
503,SJ what a well written post! Thanks for sharing your insights and feelings about how you felt about the miscommunication. You and the AFGG team did an excellent job working together to get the job done. In particular I personally thought you had one of the best attitudes toward executing. Not once did I hear you complain. You were genuinely interested in solving the problem and working together and motivating your team. So props to you! :)
504,Braxton you and the team were responsible for so much before the event and you were one of the team members who contributed to the success of the game. You were one of the strongest and committed team members who showed determination and teamwork. You were also one of the most hardworking members of the team as you were willing to help others get things done. The team and the kids involve admire all the work you put in and you should be proud! Great job Braxton and thank you.
505,Ah online SRA group work. I minored in SRA and finished most of my courses through world campus too. Doing group work with others online was not easy for me especially because students taking World Campus courses online were very different from what I expected. A lot of those who I worked with were moms/dads and in the military so coordinating times to meet with them virtually seemed almost impossible for me! What challenges are you facing right now?
506,Emir I'm sure you're having a difficult semester and I know it's really stressful! What I admire about what you said is being able to find the ability to redirect your attitude and to embrace the challenges you're facing. It wasn't too long ago that I was in the same shoes as you- juggling 18 credits internships and figuring out my future! (AHHH!!) It's all about how react and handle everything. In the process you learn so much about yourself and what your capabilities and weaknesses are.
507,It sounds like there are so many changes that are occuring in your life right now. I think it's very fitting of you to select adaptability as a tag because that's exactly what's going to be required of you in these coming months. I hope you see the value in the challenges you're enduring and learn a lot about yourself in the process.
508,In past few days working with you I personally think you have good communication skills. Self-reflection is indeed a great way to improve oneself. As I also want to improve my communication skills as a team worker I see it important to take a step back and self-reflect to acknowledge problems and take a mental note to solve such problems.
509,Hello Sung I also had the same path where I was not sure what major I want to be in. Within my time at the university I was conflicted between business and information sciences and technology. When learning about both majors I decided at the end to choose information sciences and technology after learning about how it fits into the business world. It was interesting that you made your websites through PHP and SQL whereas I created my websites through the use of HTML and CSS. Lastly I agree that strivi
510,I  can definitely relate to the feeling of not knowing what to do or major in when entering college. Double majoring seems like it would be difficult especially because it is IST and accounting. It seems like you have a really good grasp on it though! Finding something you enjoy like SQL seems like it helped a lot...I need to find something I enjoy like that for myself
511,I agree with you Jeff. I'm starting to notice that once interns have started to work they realize how important communication skills are. Being able to articulate your opinion in convincing ways is of utmost importance in any fields you decide to enter. As I'm also a huge proponent of communication I would like to improve my own.
512,Communication skill is something that I want to improve upon as well. Meeting and communicating with the clients will surely improve communication skills while working in a project. Being an effective communicator can definitely be helpful throughout the career.
513,In this post you clearly talked about where you were last year. I think the fast pace of your previous internship really allowed you to adapt to change. However do you have any insights on how you are now? You did not talk about how you are this year.
514,It is great to hear that you had internship experience before. Having the work-experience consist of computer hardware is something relating to technology. Through opening up opportunities these experiences help develop ideas of what you want to achieve. As you stated the experiences will not only help you for graduation but also for your professional development which is what I seek in my current internship.
515,Change is a common thread that runs through all businesses today and all organizations must change quickly it's good to learn how to manage change. That's a great internship experience.
516,I think your entry is very accurate. I had a lot of fun being part of the team with you. I think the teams were divided between people who were competitive and those who were not.
517,Hiii! I agree this experience helped me gain communication skills critical thinking and leadership skills. I really enjoyed being in the same group as you:) But I also think that the group number should have been smaller so everyone can contribute and complete the escape room together.
518,Problem solving skill is something that we need to hone regularly to keep the feel of it. I think escape room was a good exercise to train our skills too.
519,It is great that the IQ Escape room was a learning experience for you. Not only did you have fun working with others this allowed you and fellow interns to enhance their teamwork skills. This is important as you work together during the internship.
520,It is great to reflect on the fact that not everyone is experienced in escape room. Although most of the team is not experienced as you have stated they completed the tasks successfully. I believe that every intern is determined and put effort to help the team which lead to success in the escape room.
521,Hey Justin! I'm glad that your group was able to solve all the clues and finish the escape room on time. My group also had setbacks but we also worked together to get past every step. The escape room was definitely a great experience for building communication and teamwork.
522,That is great that you had experience in the escape room where you can lead the team. Having the escape room as a competition against another team is effective in encouraging individuals like you to work harder to help the team.
523,I cant agree more the escape room is extremely team oriented and driven. With out a strong team it is difficult to complete the tasks on time. I agree overall it was a lot of fun and  a good team bonding experience.
524,Hey Phong I think your statements regarding the teamwork at SURGE is extremely accurate. I have noticed that the interns worked in a very professional manner in meetings and being very open with ideas. Everyone was very involved and taking down ideas and mixing in their own aspects.
525,Hey Tim I think your observation in Kristine's management has been quite correct however I think you do pretty well as a leader. The tasks has to be taken by somebody and those that want to work on something will most likely speak up. There are a lot of tedious task that we have to do but every task is a learning experience.
526,Hi Manae. I agree that communication is the most important aspect in a team. A team cannot function properly if the members within it cannot bring themselves to work together to achieve a common goal especially back and forth between clients.
527,Hi Keon. Communication is definitely a big factor that plays into working in a team especially at Surge. I think that what makes a team function well in a working environment is how the members speak to each other and how each of them are willing to get the work done especially in a professional setting.
528,As being a teammate of yours I think you did great job communicating with the team members and delegating works to right people. I really appreciate that as it made the entire team better.
529,Thanks for your comment. I find it very important to utilize each other's talent here together we learn grow and succeed!
530,Agreed! It is great that slack helps everyone to keep each other updated and we can easily check it on different platforms as well.
531,I agree that teamwork is a skill that is very helpful in preparing oneself to work in a job that requires team collaboration. Having every individual in the team communicating effectively and the same understanding of a project is effective towards making progress. Overall I would want to develop my teamwork skills to lead a team effectively in communicating with one another and the ability to express their ideas.
532,That's a great goal! I think the first way to being would be to participate more in meetings.
533,That's a great goal! I think the first way to meeting this goal would be to participate more in meetings.
534,I agree that communication is an important skill to ensure everyone in the team to collaborate together. Slack and other social media devices allow users to communicate effectively out of work. Although this can create a work environment where no one communicates with each other face-to-face one should try to engage in the conversation. I also learned that updating team members is helpful in ensuring everyone is on the same pace with the project progress.
535,"over the past week we've worked together on the """"wedding barn"""" project and teamwork is key in this environment.  communication is always a great attribute to continue to grow and develop and that is a great goal to set for yourself."
536,Hey Manae!! I agree with what you're saying I think communication between a team is important especially when doing research or any work. You don't want to overlap with other members and want to make sure everyone is updated on what's going on.
537,It is great that you are having more experience in Surge compared to your previous job. Learning more helps one enhance their skills and taking in constructive feedback is good to take in.
538,Hey Jeff I think it's pretty cool that you used to want to be in the medical field. Although you aren't in it anymore you're still able to volunteer and help give back to the community.
539,Hi Alex :) wow your experience sounds amazing. I think it's great that you got an opportunity to volunteer in Philippines and gain some experience.
540,Working with kids is a very difficult but rewarding experience. It's a great skill to gain and can definitely help with dealing with people in the future.
541,That is so cool that you had played with kids regularly as I love playing with kids. There are even so much to learn from them as well.
542,It sounds like you are genuinely a good team worker. I have not had a chance to work with you yet but I can tell you would be a good team member to work with.
543,It is great that the internal meetings helped improve the challenges the team has to face in prototyping. Not only that but it also helped identify the deliverables that will need to be done. Communication did become a key component in helping the team understand what needs to be completed and what is required.
544,Hey FengQi I have seen you working at SURGE since the first day but never really had the chance to communicate or work on a project with you. Reading your post about stepping out of your comfort zone about communicating I think you have been improving and doing a good job.
545,It is great that your Czech buddy found a way to unclog the food although it ended up creating a burst within the pipes. The scenario of miscommunication where your co-workers did not speak to you about their decision can cause several problems. Adapting to a different type of work environment can be difficult
546,Hey Alex I agreed that Harvard is definitely a tough project. I did start the first  week with them but it seemed that the Harvard members were very disorganized. They had no background in technology and seemed very unsure with everything.
547,Sounds exciting. I would like to hear more about your experiences!
548,It is great that you got out of your comfort zone to run for a position and win the election for the executive position within the student government. The leadership position helped you become a leader and aspire what you want to be in the future.
549,The Harvard project seems to be one of the most interesting projects of the summer. With so many moving pieces I can see how communication would be difficult. From the outside looking in it seems you are flourishing as the leader of the group.
550,Wow very interesting keep up the good work Anthony!
551,Communication is the key. Sorry to hear what happened but glad you learned a lot from the experience.
552,A very interesting situation that you had to adapt to Patrick. I think spontaneous events such these can turn a typical daily routine into an eye-catching tale.
553,As a fellow student who envisioned themselves going into the STEM field and later changing to a business path I understand your initial discomfort and applaud your ability to overcome your doubts and take the step to expand your comfort zone.
554,Wow I didn't know you can sing! Going out of comfort zone is always hard but I'm glad you had a great experience :D
555,This is pretty interesting and an outside of the box class to take. I'm not much of a dancer myself and wouldn't be comfortable in this class at all. It is impressive you were able to push yourself this far out of your comfort zone.
556,Taking on additional responsibilities through a promotion is an amazing way to push yourself to grow as an individual and professionally.  I took a promotion in the past and i was also weary of the additional duties but i realized pushing myself into that situation helped mold me into the person I am and I hope you were able to make the same personal and professional developments.
557,Good job Alex way to be a great team leader!
558,That is awesome! It's definitely impressive to see you stepping out of comfort zone during your first year. I would have not been able to run for the student government either just like many of us.
559,Wow Manae!! I volunteer at Nittany Greyhounds during the school year as well. I volunteer with my fraternity to help clean and organize the shelter. We should work together one day!
560,Hey Anthony I understand the anxiety and nerves that come with presentations. It's not easy and it takes time to build up your skills.
561,It's great that you were able to adapt to your situation. Maybe you could show us some moves next time!
562,I think you have been great in terms of contributions to projects and it is great that you are still trying to improve yourself.
563,Thank you for introducing us to Adobe XD and I'm really glad that we all learned how to prototype on it. Good luck on the Project !
564,The project you undertook sounds awesome and really encouraging. I think it is great that you took this project.
565,It is great you took the initiative of learning about how to fix your car taking action yourself instead of waiting is a great way towards facing conflict.
566,This is an awesome outside the box post. Not many people have the ability to fix their own cars and would just panic when something goes wrong. So it was nice to read about something different that most people can't do.
567,Class projects are always a challenge it was creative to ask a family member for help. This is not something I would have even thought to do. This is a great problem solving technique.
568,You seem like a very precise person. Attention to the detail is important and I am happy to hear you got it done.
569,It is great that you took the approach of learning a new skill such as photo-shopping. Not to mention you took the initiative of learning by developing your own work and having the desire to improve it. Lastly when faced with the conflict of blending the faces in the pictures you did not give up even when you could not find any resources to help you. You were able to successfully complete the project and blend the faces.
570,That is very impressive. Figuring out syntax errors is extremely frustrating and challenging to do. Understanding the project and pushing yourself to finish the project definitely helped you figure out syntax errors as well.
571,Your techniques on steps and overall problem solving is very logical and great.
572,Finding what clients want and what we have is necessary steps in doing projects. Glad you were able to use your previous skills to solve the problems.
573,Hi Sung I also agree that communication is a key when you're working in a big group. Lot of times there are miscommunication so I think making things clear with your team is super important.

587,Vydeepthi Wow! Thank you for sharing your Hawaiian Experience. The details and descriptions of the scenery people activities and food brought your post to life. I could almost feel the warm breeze and smell the salty sea. Watching animals in their natural habitat is truly humbling. What is included in a typical feast in Hawaii? As a reminder

591,Kevin Your experience growing up in Puerto Rico as someone of Chinese ethnicity definitely sounds unique. Thank you for sharing. How did you originally come to live in Puerto Rico and what prompted the relocation to the US? Specifically what differences have you observed in the cultures
592,I was born there because my parents decided to open up a restaurant business there. I relocated to the US because my parents decided that we can have better educational opportunities in the US. In Puerto Rico the demographic was not as blended as it is in the US because almost everyone was Puerto Rican. The area that I lived in was more rural because the island is very small so most cities were simple with family owned stores and only a couple chain stores.
593,Danny I can only imagine the fear you must have been feeling. Other than the enlarged lymph node what symptoms if any did you have? I am also curious as to why they sent you to Pittsburg. In any case
594,Thanks Maddie!The feast included authentic foods from Hawaii New Zealand Tahiti and Samoa. It was really yummy!
595,Danny Your response is well written and provides concrete insight behind your thoughts and opinions. I agree Face-time is crucial and invaluable! Did you attend a Career or Job Fair this fall? If so how did your personal experience compare with your reflections?
596,Simon Absolutely. I am here to help you learn and grow. We will experience success and failure along the way but that is part of the process. As always I am here to help!
597,"Simon I am so impressed with your confidence and willingness to embrace something new. Now that you had such a positive experience with this adventure what is next on your """"bucket list""""?"
598,"Kevin Do you miss Puerto Rico? Do you prefer the US? What are your thoughts on the simplicity of Puerto Rico and the """"complexity"""" of the US? """"Island Time versus Rat Race""""? Does that make sense?"
599,The culture is much more concentrated because the majority is Puerto Rican unlike the US which is a home to many different cultures and ethnicity.
600,Shannon Firstly kudos to you for creating a catchy title and including a related photo. Secondly your opinion is solidly backed with personal experiences. Since you have been to two completely different Career Events what makes one “better” than the other? You mentioned that attending a Career Event helped you earn an internship. How do you make yourself stand out in a sea of hundreds of applicants.
601,Alex A team-oriented sport such as soccer definitely aids in the development of communication skills. Talking on the field is an essential part of success. Specifically how do you think soccer helped you to gain grit?
602,Danny Thank you for reflecting on a time when you had to use your problem-solving skills. By the sounds of it you were able to successfully regroup and implement a plan. I commend you for having the courage to let your friend go. After all he was not fulfilling the expected duties and requirements. Well done! Remember this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!
603,Kevin I agree. You definitely took a step in the direction towards conquering your fear of heights. Based on what you shared in your reflection I would say you were extremely brave that day at Dorney Park. Grit could have been a “tag” as well. Did your friends know that you were experiencing varying emotions?
604,Mollie Thank you for sharing such a beautiful and heartfelt post on the importance of traveling experiencing cultures and protecting mother earth. What if any
605,Rafay Thank you for sharing your opinions about and experiences with the job interviewing. How do you think this process might differ from one country to the next knowing that cultural expectations and innuendos many come into play?
606,Shannon I agree. Group activities such as sports are an excellent way to develop and refine communication skills. What specific tactics and techniques did you and your teammates use to connect with one another on the field? What happened if miscommunication arose?
607,Simon According to many of your reflections you have embraced the Penn State experience wholeheartedly. For the majority of people taking that first step outside of our boxes is quite difficult. As I have said before I commend you for your courage. How do you think your life would have differed had you not attended the Club Fair?
608,Christine Procrastination is such an interesting topic. Some people embrace it while others steer clear of it. Why do you think that is the case? Now that you have changed your approach to accomplishing tasks how would you advice someone else on finding balance?
609,Vydeepthi As always you’ve created a catchy title and included a personalized photo. Doing so helps to engage the reader from the beginning. Bravo! Your reflection is especially moving as it captures and emphasizes your selflessness and willingness to volunteer and lead. What makes you gravitate to these types of projects and roles?
610,Thanks Maddie! I'm passionate about helping people and giving back to the community which is the main reason I try to be involved with such projects.
611,I believe they knew that I was feeling those emotions because I've told them before that I've never ridden a big roller coaster and that I have a fear of heights. I expressed how I felt after I got off the ride because that's what people normally do after experiencing something new and different they want to share how they felt.
612,Chris As the Dalai Lama said “Be kind when possible. It is always possible.” On the Thursday morning you described you did just that. How we treat others truly reflects who we are as a person. Do you recall a time when someone was especially kind to you? How did that make you feel?
613,Kristen Thank you for reflecting on a time when you had to use your problem-solving skills. Obviously you successfully determined the issue at hand and went above and beyond in the customer service department . Well done. Remember this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!
614,Kristen Thank you for sharing your Aruban experience. Did the various cultures stand alone or mesh together?  Depending on your response why do you think that is the case? As a reminder this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!
615,Kristen I agree face-time is crucial and invaluable! Nonetheless how do you make yourself stand out in a sea of hundreds of applicants? Can you backup your reflection with actual “research”?
616,Alex As Aesop said “No act of kindness no matter how small is ever wasted.” Experiences which cause us to feel left out or vulnerable definitely encourage us to be more sympathetic and empathetic towards others. Have you ever been in a situation where it was difficult to be kind?
617,Danny Wow! Not only were you kind in this situation but honest as well. Two qualities that should never be overlooked. When you first approached the lost items and were contemplating what to do what was going through your mind? How did you feel when you realized how grateful the young lady was? What did you learn from this experience?
618,Mollie Random acts of kindness are a wonderful way to show others how much we care. Do you think all cultures value gestures such as these? Why or why not?
619,Simon As always you’ve created a catchy title and included a personalized photo. Doing so helps to engage the reader from the beginning. Bravo! Additionally your kindness and selflessness speaks volumes. Hold on to and confidently embrace these qualities. They are truly invaluable. Why do you think kindness comes easy for some and not so much for others?
620,Christine Joaquin Phoenix once said “It takes nothing away from a human to be kind to an animal.” Reading your reflection touched my heart. Your act of kindness was so incredibly caring and thoughtful. Why do you think kindness comes easy for some and not so much for others?
621,Hi thank you Maddie. I think one of the reasons why kindness comes easier for some and not for others is because a person is a product of her/his environment. But of course plenty of people have come from bad places yet still have a tender heart and vice versa so it's a complex question.
622,Chris I would agree. Organization plays a large role in achieving success. Additionally in our culture in this “day and age” we tend to take on entirely too much. “No”
623,Alex Wow! Your experience is a true example of failure being the secret to success. Thank you for sharing. As far as skill tags go I would recommend including Adaptability and Grit. You obviously demonstrate both of these the second time around. As always well done.
624,Vince I agree. With the good comes the bad and with the bad comes the good. Life is all about how you embrace and accept both. You put a positive spin on a negative situation which eventually worked out in your favor. I commend you for that. As far as skill tags go I would recommend including Adaptability as well.  Have you ever experienced a strictly academic failure?
625,Justin I am in agreeance. Failures teach us more than success. I wonder why that is the case? What are your thoughts? Kudos for trying out for a sport with which you weren’t familiar and for being mature enough to reflect on your wins and loses. Grit and Risk Taking are perfect tags for this post.
626,Lacey Wow! Like Alex your experience is a true example of failure being the secret to success. Thank you for sharing. As far as skill tags go you did a nice job of choosing the appropriate ones. Well done.
627,Vince Thank-you for sharing details about your internship with a start-up. Excellent advice I might add as well. Sometimes our greatest experiences come from the most unexpected places. Can you offer any tips or resources regarding how one should go about approaching an internship with a smaller company?
628,Kristen What a unique topic about which to reflect. Thank you for sharing! Personally I agree wholeheartedly. Musicals should be experienced by everyone at least once in their life-time. They captivate and inspire like no other. Initially what drew you to musicals?
629,Justin What a heart-wrenching yet uplifting experience. Thank-you for taking the time to share it. I believe it was Aesop who said “No act of kindness no matter how small
630,Dom Wow! What an authentic reflection. In actuality I got chills. I loved how you confidently poured your heart and soul into this post. Your story is a perfect example of what this platform is all about. Kudos!
631,Alex Without a doubt I too agree that you are hard-working patient and true. You have clearly and strongly demonstrated these qualities throughout the duration of the internship. I admire that you embrace your unique self and change for no one. Yet you are kind and helpful to those with whom you interact. You have earned my utmost respect!
632,"Alex Agreed! We ALL have our own unique imperfections. I commend you for being so perceptive. Most people do not or choose not to see their """"flaws"""" let alone take steps to improve upon them. Although doing so is not necessarily easy it is important. How else does one work on bettering oneself?!"
633,"Alex I am not surprised that your survey results yielded kindness as one of your qualities. I picked up on that within the first few weeks of interacting with you and watching your interact with others. As far as """"love"""" goes...I'll leave you with the following resource should you so choose to explore it:  https://www.5lovelanguages.com/"
634,Alex I agree! Pivoting is challenging but by no means is cowardly. Do you have specific examples of a time when you persevered and a time when you pivoted?
635,"Alex Downloading music is an excellent example of an ethical dilemma. Bravo for taking the """"high road""""."
636,Vince No doubt Gryffindor is an excellent house in which to be placed. I agree you work well in groups and poses sound leadership qualities. It is safe to say the Sorting Hat knows what it is doing!
637,"Vince Great advice! Analyzing potential outcomes of decisions related to persevering or pivoting is absolutely the way to go. Thank you for providing concrete examples of when you had to make decisions """"to stay or to go"""". Bravo!"
638,Vince What a well written reflection! I couldn't agree more or have said it better myself. When we are kind to ourselves acknowledge and embrace our imperfections and work to improve upon them we truly develop into the people we are meant to be!
639,Justin I've always admired the witches and wizards of Ravenclaw for their eccentricity. They are who they are they are proud of it and they don't care what other people think. We all could learn a thing or two from this perspective!
640,"I commend you for recognizing your """"flaws"""" acknowledging that improvements can be made and working towards doing so. Not an easy task for most but important nonetheless. For the most part I am a people person"
641,Justin I agree. Each individual and situation is unique. Therefore choosing to persevere or pivot isn't a point blank decision. Check out Vince's post when you get the chance.
642,Molly Thank you for taking the time to share a specific example of when failure led to success for you. When in the midst of falling short we often have difficulty processing emotions feelings etc. Nonetheless
643,Molly No doubt Gryffindor has produced countless invaluable witches and wizards. Sounds like you would have fit in with this house quite nicely. I mean the Sorting Hat hasn't been wrong yet! Thanks for sharing.
644,"Molly I agree. Our """"weaknesses and flaws"""" should not make us susceptible to the ridicule of others. Embracing and loving who you are as a unique human being is so very important. Nonetheless working to make improvements to become a better person is just as invaluable."
645,Molly Thank you for sharing  your survey results. These are all wonderful qualities to posses and hone!
646,Molly do you have specific examples of when you had to choose to persevere and/or pivot?
647,Dom Wow! That sounds like a frustrating experience. Failure is a hard thing to accept process and from which to learn. Especially in the moment. Now that several months have gone by
648,"Dom Thank you for sharing such an honest and heartfelt response. Acknowledging embracing and improving upon our """"flaws"""" is not always an easy task. In fact as you said"
649,Dom I second that! There are numerous aspects and characteristics of each house which resonate with me as well. Great final statement about prominence.
650,Dom Your kindness shows like a bright and shiny gem! Thanks for sharing your survey results.
651,Dom What a unique way to view persevere or pivot -- fight or flight! Thank you for sharing your outlook and perspectives.
652,Dom Love the quote! Kudos to you for selflessly giving of yourself on a consistent basis.
653,Rafay Wow! Thank you for sharing this beautiful collection of information about Ramadan. I thoroughly enjoyed reading more about the holy month and all that it entails. Learning about other cultures and religions gives great insight into what others are doing to be kind and giving.
654,"Rafay Thank you for taking the time to share a personal """"failure turned success"""" experience. Kudos to you for taking the necessary steps to ensure improvement of your writing skills."
655,Rafay Thanks so much for sharing your survey results. I often wonder why some people are surprised by their results and others are not. Perhaps questions aren't being answered honestly? Any thoughts?
656,Rafay Handling ethical dilemmas are no doubt difficult. Through friends and family into the mix and things can get quite dicey. Bravo for choosing the morale pathway and encouraging/guiding your friend to do the same.
657,"V Thank you for being so open and honest in the sharing of your """"failure turned success"""" experience. Therapy is a wonderful tool. It gives great insight into who you are as a person and provides tools to help you cope learn and grow -- mentally physically"
658,V this is awesome! How wonderful that you give of yourself and your time. Thank you for sharing information about your village and your volunteer experience.
659,Lacey Gryffindor is an excellent house in which to be placed. Obviously so by the mention of witches and wizards who were sorted there as well. Bravery is definitely a strong quality to posses. Do you recall certain situations in which you had to demonstrate this characteristic?
660,Lacey You and I in many ways are one and the same. People pleasing often stems from the desire to be kind and helpful. What a wonderful thing! But self care and love are equally as important. For example when traveling on an airplane
661,Lacey There is no doubt that you are kind creative and hopeful! I saw these in you on day one. You have a vibrant and delightful personality that will serve you well and should!
662,Lacey Yes pivoting doesn't equate to throwing in the towel. One simply chooses to change direction or course along the way. There is no right or wrong when deciding to persevere or pivot. It's when no action is taken that things become dicey!
663,Chris Thank you for sharing the interesting information/story about Jim Fitz. Can you provide a specific experience in which you had to decide to persevere or pivot? Is one choice better than the other?
664,"Simon Future said it well! Without failure how would we every develop and grow in all aspects of our lives?! Although it can """"sting"""" failure is a sure fast way to improve."
665,Simon Nice job relating your Pottermore House results to your personal real-life experiences. Interesting I would have pegged you for a Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw! The Sorting Hat never is wrong though! :)
666,Simon Thank you for sharing such an open and honest response. We are all tempted at some point in our lives and choosing to act morally can be difficult. Kudos to you for making the right decision.
667,Christine There were many great witches and wizards who were placed in Slytherin as well. I agree I feel as though I am a mix of many of the houses. However the Sorting Hat has yet to be wrong. :)
668,Christine Being aware of and acknowledging our quirks is an insightful way to develop and grow in all aspect of our lives. I loved how you evaluated the positives and negatives of each imperfection and how they can be put to good use. Well done!
669,Christine YES! Sometime letting go is the healthiest choice to make.
670,"Christine You seem to have a way with mediating particularly difficult situations. I recall an instance in one of your early posts where you tactfully intervened during a """"friend dilemma"""". Thanks for sharing."
671,Christine What a wonderful experience. I was so happy to read that you chose something to which you felt connected. Thank you for giving selflessly!
672,Kevin No act of kindness is ever too small! In fact sometimes they have the most profound impacts.
673,Kevin Asking for help certainly can be difficult. Unfortunately I believe we've been made to feel weak insufficient
674,Kevin You aren't the only one who thinks we all have traits and characteristics of each of the four houses. And I agree!
675,"Kevin All we can do is our best to acknowledge and improve our """"quirks"""" if need be. Recognizing imperfections can be the hardest part. Hopefully we all have one or two people in our lives that can lovingly and kindly help us to develop and grow."
676,Kevin I agree. Knowing when to persevere or pivot is nearly impossible. Sometimes we just have to make the most informed decision possible and move on no matter the outcome. Thank you for sharing personal experiences!
677,Kevin Thank you for actually volunteering and giving selflessly. I saw a photo of your group and it looked as though you had a great experience with each other as well.
678,Kristin As I read your post tears rolled down my cheeks. I am beyond humbled by your thoughtful and selfless giving. WOW!
679,Kristen Thank you for sharing this beautiful experience and for choosing to do something about which you are so passionate. Despite your own health concerns you still were willing to give your time and love.
680,"Joseph Ravenclaw is a fine house in which to be placed. It produced many wonderful witches and wizards. Most people believe they belong in Gryffindor. I wonder if that is because it's """"Harry Potter's"""" House."
681,Joseph Can you please provide specific personal imperfections and quirks?  Remember this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!
682,Joseph Some people believe that pivoting is the same as quitting or failing. I second your thoughts. If after thoroughly evaluating a situation outcome etc. you determine pivoting is in your best interest
683,i liked reading how you were able to help your teammate. Picking others up and giving guidance can often be the most rewarding.
684,Piyan Thanks for sharing. As a reminder this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self! Please be sure to answer the provided prompt.

689,Lyndon Thanks much for sharing your expectations of yourself and this internship. I'm excited to watch you learn and grow over the next few months. You've got a lot to bring to the table.  As a reminder this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!
690,Vlad Yes! Your response is spot on. Having fun in life is so very important. I love that you mentioned teaching others as well as learning from them. Kudos.  As a reminder this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!
691,Rory How right you are...we all have our own expertise to share which makes us one heck of a cohesive unit. Woot woot!  As a reminder this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!
692,Trevor You've outlined some excellent expectations for yourself us and the entire internship team. What particularly stood out to me was that you wanted to be unafraid to fail. How very important. By human nature we are bound to fail. Becoming comfortable with doing so is vital to success. As a reminder
693,Rihad Your title is very catchy. It is safe to assume Cardi B. was your inspiration? We are definitely excited to have you as part of the team.  As a reminder this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!
694,Isha You couldn't be more right. Failing and being wrong is more than okay. I struggle with accepting this as well. Through experience when we push ourselves we have the opportunity to grow and develop in ways we may have never imagined. You got this girl! Excited to have you on board.  As a reminder this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!
695,Stephen The image you used to support your written reflection is catchy and appropriate. Nice choice. We are excited to watch you learn be challenged and grow!

As a reminder this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!
698,Gillian We are super excited to have you as part of the team. Your different experiences and perspectives will help us all to grow and develop in ways we may not otherwise would have had the opportunity to do.  As a reminder this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!
699,"Gillian Wow! How insightful of you. I'm impressed that you took the initiative to """"change it up"""" when you noticed your team was not necessarily producing the outcomes you were seeking."
700,Di Thank you for sharing the sincere thoughts and emotions you experienced when viewing the dollhouse. To be honest I got a bit choked up when you mentioned the promise to your father.  How very humble and kind.
701,"Eric I completely agree. Creativity lives in all of us and viewing art can assist in """"drawing"""" that side of ourselves out. Honestly I struggled with visiting museums and galleries at first too. I kept seeking the """"correct"""" interpretation. Finally I realized we all had valuable viewpoints to offer."
702,"Gillian I couldn't agree more. Attending as a group was far more beneficial than I expected. As life progresses keeping in touch with those we care about has a tendency to become more and more challenging because we are all so darn busy. However if the relationships are important we must make an effort to communicate. What methods will you use to """"reconnect?"""""
703,Isha I thoroughly enjoyed listening to you share the feelings that fighting peacock sculpture brought out of you. You smiled so sincerely when you spoke of your mother and that pulled at my heart strings. I can only image how lovely growing up in a peacock decorated house must have been.
704,Leo Your reflection is written beautifully. I'm sitting here at my computer with chills as I read over your post. When you spoke of your childhood in Taiwan I felt as though I was there at that same bridge. Additionally the way in which you described the peacefulness of Palmer was spot on. Thanks for sharing.
705,Lyndon WOW! Your reflection is incredibly insightful and thoughtful. Your interpretation is on a level of its own. Just...WOW!
706,"Max The painting also made me realize how interesting and attracting something can be even though it isn’t necessarily perfect or planned out."""" This statement is so profound. As a Type A I needed to read this today. Thanks for sharing!"
707,Pierre I agree. Having the tour guide was extremely helpful. I visited the Dali Museum in St. Pete (https://thedali.org/) and opted for a recorded guide because I had no clue what I was looking at but new each piece of artwork represented something significant and meaningful.
708,Piyan I was incredibly moved by what you shared during our tour today. I could see and feel how passionate and excited you were about this particular piece. Is there a picture of the sunflower seed installation that you could share?
709,Rory I literally do not have enough insight or profound words to add to your reflection. I can't recall the last time I was speechless. So you know I posted the weekly bulletin before I read your story and...was in the back of the crowd when you spoke to the group!
710,"Daphne The way you articulated your interpretation of the """"Venus"""" painting today...and now this....I"
711,"m not on your level as far as """"interpretation goes"""". Although art isn't your first interest you have a knack!"
712,"Stephen Oh to be a kid again!"""" Right?! I enjoyed listening to you reminisce about your childhood at the museum yesterday. Your smile is telling of your positive attitude and friendly demeanor. If you don't mind me asking what types of food could you expect to find on your table back then?"
713,"Vlad You've touched on some truly important points. Taking the time to """"stop and smell the roses"""" if you will is becoming even more seldom as technology continues to evolve. You addressed imagining and re-centering which are vital to our growth as well-rounded humans. Thanks for sharing your views and opinions and for doing so in a respectful and open manner."
714,Wesley You pulled at my heart strings when you spoke so dearly and lovingly of your grandmother. I could feel the profound love she had for nature when you described various attributes of the painting. Thanks for the moving experience.
715,Thank you so much for sharing this Di. I know its not easy to open up like that to people you just met but you were so sincere and I loved how you talked about the promise to your father. Thank you for allowing us into this part of your life.
716,This was such an amazing analysis of this painting something I never would of thought of myself. Thank you so much for sharing.
717,There was all types of food on the table! It changed from day to day but fruits like apples and bananas were definitely a staple as my parents wanted me to eat healthy snacks. At times there would also be some chips and shortbread cookies.
718,Thank you Maddie! Really appreciate you and Kerry brought us to Palmer Museum it was a very interesting and amazing experience! Definitely looking forward to visiting the museum again with the same group of people.
719,wow this post touches the heart
720,"I think that I have to approach communication different ways. For my aunt and my cousins Facebook and social media would probably work and it would be much easier because I love talking to them! However I love my Gran but I often find it hard to just """"chat"""" with her because she isn't an immediate part of my life (being that she lives so far away). I really do want her to become more involved in my life though so maybe I could just open up and give her updates one day?"
721,Gillian You have meshed unbelievable well with the others. To be honest I don't think anyone noticed you weren't IT. The different perspectives you are bringing to the table are helping us all to grow in unpredictable ways. My heart is tickled that you are making friends although I had no doubt. Your personality is a breath of fresh air.
722,"Max Yes! Should something come to mind please share. We truly value feedback and ideas. Are you thinking another """"tool"""" like Photoshop or more along the lines of a different project?"
723,"Pierre I am beyond stoked to have read that ya'll created two """"social groups"""". These are exactly the types of relationships we were hoping to see cultivated. Honestly I have chills. :) Thanks for sharing your personal and professional experiences thus far."
724,Rihad Hands down your titles are the most creative and comical. Kudos. When sharing do your best to pin point specifics. Your titles draw in the reader and the details will keep them reading. Looking forward to watching you grow and develop.
725,Rory You've had an impressive start to the internship -- voicing opinions taking leads offering assistance -- all of which have been a delight to observe. Obviously you are a team player but you can be in charge as well. What a combination! Bravo.
726,Shawn Agreed. Your smile positive attitude and thirst for learning are serving you well and will continue to do so in this internship and beyond. Something else that I noticed is as a leader you LISTEN! You are off to a stellar start for sure.
727,Trevor Being able to step into the roles of leader and/or teammate are a vital part of individual and group success. You do both quite well. Bravo! Is there anything you would change or add to the first two weeks of the internship experience?
728,"Wesley I absolutely love that making new friendships and life-long connections is a goal of yours for this internship. I heard there was a """"Surge Ballers"""" group. Way cool! How do you feel about the projects thus far?"
729,Thank you for the response! Yep the Surge Ballers are great! The projects thus far are very interesting and fun! I enjoy website designing and developing flyers and postcards for clients to use. Can't wait to see them in their business!
730,"I am thinking more along the lines of another """"tool"""" such as Photoshop. I'm still not entirely sure what kind of tool but should one come to mind I will definitely share."
731,Shawn Wow. What a remarkable story. I can't say thank you enough for sharing this raw information as well as how the negative experiences have impacted and changed your life for the better. When we share tribulations and triumphs with one another the likely hood of us growing closer as a human race is much greater.
732,Pierre What an incredible story. Michael Jordan's basketball journey came to mind when I read about your triumphs and tribulations with soccer. If you don't mind me asking what emotions were you experiencing when you did not make the team initially?
733,Di Thanks for sharing your struggle with test taking. Specifically what did you do differently the second time around?
734,Rory How did you come to the realization that you wanted to purse IST? Perhaps an epiphany dream or pro/con list? Do you ever wonder why the boredom of the business classes did not jolt you into recognizing that wasn't the major for you?
735,"Trevor No doubt changing majors was a tough decision for you. Your thought process from """"I'm not happy."""" to """"I need to do research."""" favored you well. As I'm sure you have heard Kerry mention we often have to choose when to persevere and when to pivot. Personally I believe a wrong decision is better than indecision. Although this is one of my biggest struggles. I'm happy you are happy!"
736,Di Thank you for openly sharing your experiences with risk taking. You mentioned that you did not have a back-up plan regarding attending college in the states. As you continue to grow develop and take risks are you more inclined to have a Plan B? Why or why not?
737,"Wesley Yes although this experience was a failure it will serve you well in the future. Your comment about over promising is spot on. At Live It we too have done the same and the results often aren't """"pretty"""". Learning to set realistic expectations is a much more positive approach for all involved. Thanks for candidly sharing."
738,"Wesley your reflection is detailed and well written. Kudos! I loved that you emphasized how the group sympathetically and emphatically """"laughed"""" at each others' failures. Creating that kind of atmosphere will allow all of you to open up and seek help when the situation is more serious. This is by far your best post to date."
739,Daphne One of my favorite things about reading your reflections is that you almost always include aspects of your culture. Your willingness to share how that interweaves with who you are becoming is like a breath of fresh air. In regards to the challenge how did you approach the redesign process? (Thanks for including the video link.)
740,Rihad Thank you for sharing this personal difficult experience. I can relate. My father is dying of cancer and this weekend I had to rush to my parent's house to assist with his care. Unfortunately I did get pulled over. As I continue to reflect on Saturday morning I can say I am not happy about having to pay a fine
741,I more inclined to have no back-up so that I can push myself out there and face the things that I am doing directly and try my best.
742,Isha Thank you for sharing your failures in relation to your team. I love that each of you are embracing your culture expressing it through dance and sharing it with others. How cool! I couldn't agree more our egos often do more harm than good. I'm curious
743,Leo I can't even begin to imagine what it must have been like for you to have to make such a difficult and impactful decision at such a young age. Do you ever wonder if some of your family had not already been in the United States if you would have made the choice to stay in your home country?
744,Thanks for the compliment Maddie! I usually approach the redesign by making the process smoother. Sine if your machine stops you are out of the competition we want to make sure everything works smoothly. Second we will see if we can make the machine building process easier and faster. That are the two targets we aimed for redesigning the machine.
745,Eric Thank you for openly sharing the risks you took by accepting the internship position at Surge. Lack of financial resources is definitely a cause for concern. How will your choice of pursuing Surge impact your future decisions?
746,Gillian In no way shape or form should you feel dumb or inferior. Perhaps the insight you were meant to gain out of this experience was in relation to the capabilities of your peers.  Additionally knowing when to lead
747,Max First of all your reflection is extremely well written. Second congrats on the buzzer beater! I loved reading about how you went from a solid yet somewhat reserved player to the teammate calling the shots and putting the game on his shoulders. How did this experience influence other aspects of your life if at all?
748,"Max Thanks for being upfront and honest about your preference of experiences. I don't suppose you have thought of any way to improve or completely revamp the """"snack activity""""?"
749,Lyndon Wow! Your reflection is not only well written but extremely insightful. What a unique take on winning and losing. Obviously this is a concrete example of how failure can ultimately turn into success...it's all in the way one define it.
750,Lyndon I'm curious...what made you say no in high school but yes last summer? Age? Maturity? Growth? Confidence?
751,Piyan Thank you for sharing your thoughts after two weeks at Surge. You mentioned that you hoped the days would get better. What ideas or suggestions do you have to offer for improvement? We would love to hear them.
752,Piyan Would you mind adding more specifics to your reflection? In detail at what did you fail during your last internship? How did that failure impact your approach in school and in other opportunities?
753,Piyan Wow. I didn't realize that once you chose an educational path in your culture there was no turning back. I can't even begin to imagine what it must have been like to make such a major decision as a teenager. How has this choice impacted your willingness to take chances as you continue to grow into your unique-self?
754,I think that this experience gave me the confidence when taking risks in other aspects of my life. I became more comfortable taking risks in other aspects of my life after this game. No matter what the outcome is I have become more comfortable taking risks outside of sports.
755,"I think the """"snack activity"""" would be more beneficial if it were paired with a more in depth story about your childhood. Explaining a little about how you're attached to the snack is good but being able to tie it into a specific story would give it more meaning."
756,I would say that it was both my personal growth and overall confidence improving that led me to saying yes.
757,Di Thank you for sharing this experience with the group. To be clear ethics are morale principles. For example while walking through campus you find a wallet on the Hub lawn. The dilemma here becomes whether to keep the wallet or turn it in. Does that make sense?
758,"Isha Nice job relating the Escape Room experience with those you encounter in the """"real-world"""". At any point during the game did your team struggle with communication? If so how did you approach resolving this issue. If not how did you develop your plan and execute it so well?"
759,"Leo Based on your description of your experience with the Escape Room it is obvious that soft-skills were being utilized and strengthened. Delegation and playing to each other's individual strengths is certainly a recipe for success. Looking back did anything go awry or is there anything you would have done differently? How does an experience like this help with those you encounter in the """"real-world""""?"
760,Lyndon How do you think we did with our overall communication and execution? Be honest! :)
761,Max First of all you have the absolute best title for this reflection topic. I can easily picture Michael and Holly dancing in the conferencing room. To be honest I am surprised by your friends' positive response. Typically most people react defensively. Have you ever thought about what you would have done if they would have disregarded your advice?
762,Pierre I asked Lyndon the same question...Overall how do you think our team did with communication and execution? Be honest!
763,Rory What a useful experience to have. I loved reading about your thought process and problem solving from start to finish...1. Recognize the issue 2. Brainstorm potential solutions 3. Test best solution 4. Gain feedback 5. Revise plan 6. Repeat
764,"Shawn You share such raw experiences and I absolutely love it! These are exactly the types of situations on which we need to reflection and around which """"learning"""" conversations should be geared. In my opinion I think you took the right steps and made the right decisions at the right times. You approached your co-worker and engaged with him in a non-threatening way. The maturity you showed is commendable!"
765,Vlad Thank you for being so candid with your response. I am always appreciative of your honesty. The corporate culture Tony has created since his first failure is extremely interesting and obviously beneficial. If you were to begin a start-up what particular aspects would you be sure to include? PS. I struggled with the test as well. For the most part my answers were in the middle.
766,Vlad You do have a personality that not only accepts failure but embraces it wholeheartedly and obviously benefits from it. From now on I'll be making an effort to channel my inner Vlad. You mentioned that not being negatively affected by failure may be a result of genetics. Is there anything else you can contribute to your outlook?
767,Wesley Thank you for sharing openly and candidly about this ethical dilemma. Obviously you made the right decision but the loss of a friend can be difficulty to accept and digest. When we are in situations such as this we may want to ask our selves what type of people we are surrounding ourselves with if they ultimately decide to discontinue communication. Hmm...Tony Zappos was on to something!
768,Daphne I'll ask the you the same question I asked Lyndon and Pierre...How do you think we did as a team regarding our communication leadership etc. Be honest!
769,I was surprised by their reactions too. I think because it was close to the end of the semester they realized it truly wasn't worth the risk at this point. Maybe if I stepped in earlier they would have been more disregarding of my advice. However if they had disregarded my advice I would have considered going to the teacher but it would have been something I thought long and hard about.
770,I wish you the best in your future projects!
771,Isha Agreed! Although we know academic cheating (or any for that matter) is not right when I friend is involved it can be difficult to make the correct call. Obviously you handled the situation with grace and dignity. Offering to provide your friend with a crash course and choosing to sit in the opposite row were kind and commendable choices. Kudos!
772,"Agreed. Talking to someone higher up on the """"food chain"""" often gets viewed as """"tattle-tale-ing""""."
773,"Pierre Kudos for stepping outside of your box. Plus you are earning additional income and you won't have to worry about riders """"dirtying"""" your car. What a cool idea to pursue."
774,Stephen Yes this was a particularly challenging experience of which to be a part. Willingly volunteering to join the team was a risk in and of itself. How do you believe this will affect your future risk-taking endeavors?
775,"Trevor Agreed. Speaking up in team meetings can definitely be intimidating and risky. Now that you are beginning to become more comfortable doing so how do you think this will affect your decision to voice your opinions in the """"real world""""?"
776,Trevor Could you elaborate a bit more. What new recipe have you tried to create in the last week?
777,"Vlad Thank you for openly and candidly sharing about your unethical and ethical experience. Do you have a """"thought process"""" for determining when using your exceptional technical skills is for the good/bad?"
778,"Vlad Agreed! At first traveling on your own can definitely be scary. Especially until you get acclimated to the """"process"""". I'm curious did you take any particular steps or use any particular """"tools"""" to ease/clarify your mind along the way? How did the journey there compare to the journey home?"
779,Wesley How cool! Thank you for taking the time to try something new on your own. Half way up the wall is an excellent start. To be honest I've always wanted to try rock climbing as well but for some reason have been hesitant. Thanks for the encouraging push! On a side note I recently started watching the following documentary on Netflix. Holy...WOW! https://www.dawnwall-film.com/
780,Max Kudos to you for trying something new on your own. Cooking once you become comfortable can be quite rewarding. Plus doing so is a much healthier option compared to eating out all of the time. Pinterest is a great resource and there cookbooks specifically for college students as well. https://www.google.com/search?q=healthy+cookbook+for+college+students&oq=Healthy+Cookbook+for+College+Students&aqs=chrome.0.0l2.5329j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
781,"Gillian Yes kudos for at least trying. Ain't no shame in that game! Did you notice if there were any students in attendance? A note for HHD...Advertise """"Black-Tie"""". My husband and I had a similar experience at a wedding only we couldn't leave. Talk about uncomfortable and embarrassing. Nonetheless we lived to see another day. :)"
782,Rihad No worries. Unless you are blessed with a natural cooking talent doing so takes time. Having a set recipe to follow in the beginning helps as well. Don't give up. You got this.
783,Trevor I agree that while there is so much incredible art to see the trek between campus and downtown can be challenging on a hot summer day! Maybe closing off College Ave instead of Allen St could help? Glad you had a good time. Would love to try that hot sauce some day.
784,A friendly art competition would be nice! It would be interesting to see what the community appreciates when they observe the art displays.
785,Yes especially with the increased usage of credit cards and mobile payment having to grab cash at the ATM can be a hassle. Maybe you should recommend the Arts Fest committee to accept payments through hardware like Square!
786,Rachel Kudos to you for holding down a job while a full-time student. I agree that certainly is not an easy task.
787,"John Your title is catchy and creative; I was definitely intrigued to read more. Additionally I am impressed with the """"web of communication"""" that you and your peers established and maintained. Kudos!"
788,"John Your quote...""""I deem my work ethic great but not perfect. Nobody is perfect and therefore always room to improve especially when starting a career position"""" is on point."
789,Satchel I'm curious. What methods of communication is/was used? Face-to-face email text etc.?
790,Jack Kudos for pointing out all the things that went wrong with regard to communication in your project management class. As a result of that experience do you have a tendency to take the lead?
791,"Liam How right you are. Asking thoughtful questions certainly is a key to communication. Learning to """"repeat"""" what you've heard can come in handy as well. For example What I hear you saying is..."""""
792,Muhammad You mentioned that getting to the point where a team genuinely works together is a long and arduous process. Why do you think that is? What can we specifically Live It do to improve that experience?
793,Muhammad Your honesty is 100% appreciated. This platform is designed to have those candid conversations so that we all have the opportunity to learn and grow as individuals. Passion for the task at hand as well as team dynamic certainly can have an affect on output.
794,Pam You mentioned that as a group your responsibilities were divided among each member. Task delegation and trading is a key component of group success. How do you approach a situation where someone is not pulling his/her own weight?
795,Pam Thanks much for taking the time to share your expectations with regard to yourself the projects and the internship in general. As a reminder this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!
796,If someone was not pulling their own weight in a project I might reach out to them individually just to have a better understand of what is going on. Then I would discuss ways that we can work together to ensure their portion is being done on time. Hopefully I can walk away with a better understanding as to what is going on and a plan to ensure the work gets done.
797,Yes after that experience with miscommunication I make sure that everyone in the group is on the same page before moving forward.
798,Satchel Thanks much for taking the time to share your expectations with regard to yourself the projects and the internship in general. You mentioned that you would like to be able to measure outcomes with regards to your projects. Do you have a plan to do so? As a reminder this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!
799,Sean Thanks much for taking the time to share your expectations with regard to yourself the projects and the internship in general. I concur that you execute communication well; it's quite impressive. As a reminder this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!
800,Liam Thanks much for taking the time to share your expectations with regard to yourself the projects and the internship in general. Your positive attitude and outlook are a breath of fresh air. They both will serve you well in all aspects of your life. As a reminder this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills.

As a reminder this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!
803,"Muhammad Thanks much for taking the time to share your expectations with regard to yourself the projects and the internship in general. I love that your reflections are always so candid and honest. You are truly embracing the """"point"""" of this platform. As a reminder this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!"
804,Sean Thanks for sharing your insights and opinions. You bring up several valid points. Career Fairs certainly do open avenues for building networks and offer opportunities to practice and refine conversational and interviewing skills. The article you attached reinforces those viewpoints as well. Here is an interesting take on the opposite. http://ucsdguardian.org/2019/02/18/career-fairs-obsolete-world-online-networking/
805,Jack Your post is extremely well written and I love that you were open and honest about your opinions of Career Fairs. Standing in line for 1.5 to 2 hours is certainly daunting and unproductive yet personal connections are well worth the wait. I am anxious to see what the future holds with regards to career fairs. It certainly will be interesting. Thanks for sharing!
806,Jon I agree. Waiting in line and being told to apply on line is more than annoying but the potential for personal connections and networking opportunities can't be beat. I really liked your view point on the why and how of improving career fairs. Very creative as usual! :)
807,Liam Your thoughts of and opinions on career fairs is similar to those of your fellow interns. I think the questions you are asking and the concerns you have about the current processes and layouts of these events are warranted. Maybe networking needs to be redefined?
808,Pam As I mentioned to Liam you and your fellow interns have similar views on the purpose of Career Fairs. The questions comments and concerns that you have are valid and warranted. Do you have any thoughts on how to revamp career fairs so that they are more relevant?
809,Rachel I love that you and your fellow interns are questioning the point of career fairs. Doing so stirs up comments and concerns that can either lead to new and improved career fairs or the extinction of them all together. The strategies that you have taken over the years were well thought out based on your experiences. Bravo!
810,Satchel Using career fairs as a way to refine your conversational and interviewing skills and build confidence is brilliant. Even if someone is adamant about the worthlessness of career fairs participating for the sake of practice is certainly an opportunity that should be embraced.
811,Satchel Thanks much for taking the time to share your expectations with regard to yourself the projects and the internship in general. As a reminder this platform was designed to help you find the pathway that fits your own unique passions and skills. This space is free from judgement and will allow you to be your authentic self!
812,"Satchel I enjoyed reading your critique and interpretation of """"Leaving Town"""". The ways in which you described the colors and how they evoked memories from you childhood were moving. Thanks for sharing!"
813,"Tevin Thanks much for sharing your reactions and feelings towards the """"Crowded Bus"""" painting. Are you a """"This is Us"""" fan? I watched an episode last week in which one of the main characters talked about how riding the bus on a daily basis impacted her. To quote Deja “...something that makes you uncomfortable reminds me of where I’m from.”"
814,Chloe I love that you shared how the painting made you feel. From hot and torrid to cool and peaceful you certainly experienced a range. Art of all sorts evokes different emotions for different people which is truly astounding.
815,Chloe Your views are very similar to those expressed by your fellow interns. Waiting in line for 20-30 minutes only to be told to apply online certainly is frustrating. You may be right to lower your expectations and to use Career Fairs as a supplemental tool for obtaining employment.
816,John What a unique take on the symbolism of the artwork to which you took a liking. I love that you were able to tie the piece to your past present and future. Kudos!
817,Jon Distractions have a tendency to be more well...distracting when our interests are elsewhere. I'm guilty as well. I found this article to be an interesting read:  https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/09/stanford-psychology-expert-most-important-work-skill-of-the-future.html?utm_source=pocket-newtab.
818,Pam Although vulnerability is scary when we put our selves in situations that allow us to interact with others in a neutral and safe environment amazing things can happen. I'm so glad your experience was positive.
819,"Rachel I got to take a quick peak at the Augusta Savage exhibition last week and was drawn in by her story as well. Her struggles and successes rendered me speechless. The way in which you relate her experiences with yours is eye-opening. The technology field is still holding on to the """"bro-culture"""". People like you will change that no doubt."
820,Sean What a beautiful memory. The way in which art provokes feelings thoughts and visions is absolutely incredible. Thanks much for sharing such an authentic reaction.
821,Tevin I could really feel the emotion behind your reflection. Honestly I got a bit chocked up envisioning you and your brother enjoying each others' company. To me it's crazy how deep the feelings are that art brings to the surface.
822,Rachel Although making the decision to study abroad was difficult it certainly sounds like you chose wisely. Honestly I wanted to do the same. While a student in Smeal I was presented with numerous
823,Rachel study abroad does intimidate people because of the costs and possibilities of graduating later. Scholarships are possible but the costs are still a great amount. While people do say not to rush college and stay as long as you can my pockets advise against that completely. I respect the risks you were willing to take. How was your study abroad? What would you tell yourself to do instead if you had a time machine?
824,Bro! It's the bounce back that counts! We have all had those exams that were really easy but we failed because of a stupid reason. Keep up the good work! It will all pay off!
825,Rachel I think your post is very inspirational. Even though the internship was required and it was in the back of your mind it was important that you did something for yourself rather than pleasing others. I think going abroad was a really enjoyable experience that would be difficult to accomplish once you hit the workforce.
826,Satchel I also coincidentally wrote about a failed test this week. In the moment failing a test seems like the end of the world but if you take a deep breath and realize that it's just one test you start to relax. It's unfortunate you think you did poorly because of one minor mistake
827,"Tevin the painting I chose also related to my childhood/brother. Once I started college I couldn't spend as much time with him as I used to. The quote from The Office explains it best I wish there was a way to know you’re in the good old days before you’ve actually left them."""" I'm trying to hold on to my childhood as long as possible because I know that """"adulthood"""" is fast approaching."
828,"I have a similar experience. When I was taking an online course of Material Science I didn't study too much on it since the weekly quizzes and assignments were easy and time-unlimited. However the midterms and finals were much harder with limited time. I ended up with a B while many peers got an A. I think this """"failure"""" happens a lot among college students who assume they can get an easy A on easy courses. Better to learn sooner than later:)"
829,I had a strong willing to study abroad in London for one semester but the program only allows students take general education courses which may defer my graduation date so I chose not to do it. Maybe in the future I will study abroad or do an internship program. It's risky but it worths.
830,Past failures close off paths that that doesn't enable you to succeed. You've weeded out your weaknesses to be better!
831,While I know failure is indeed very frustrating I find that you'll appreciate these lessons later in the future especially learning it at your own pace.  I think it's gonna be a lot harder to progress in a buisness setup so I will cherish my freedom.
832,I think it's natural to compare yourself to your peers and to those around you. But I often found myself looking at people who had success that I didn't and it was something that really bothered me. I found that I needed to restructure the way I was thinking. Instead of looking at what they had that I didn't think of how you can achieve those same things too.
833,Jon I really enjoyed listening to your thoughts about the pieces of work we saw. While I can appreciate art from a far I don't really find myself making a lot of meaningful connections to it like you had. You think really deep and found a lot of hidden meaning in the work and it was really interesting to listen to. Thanks for being so open and willing to share your thoughts with us!
834,"Pam- while I was reading through a lot of other people's thoughts on career fairs you seem to be only one who came out with it saying they were dead. I contemplated it and kinda gave a """"kinda"""" in response but I respect you coming out with it and saying it like it is."
835,Hi jack- This is a great point especially for someone like me who can sometimes be a big procrastinator. Do you have a study plan built up yet? and if so share the secret to your success because this girl needs better time management skills.
836,Hi Jonathan- I totally agree. Everytime I used to attend mueseums as a kid I would never truly think about the story behind the art. Instead I just looked at all the pretty colors and unique experessions. I noticed during the trip that you were able to reallly engage with the artwork. Do you have passion for art?
837,Hi John- I can agree to disagree with your post. It definetely is a place to go when you would like to gain more knowledge on a companies culture but overall I do not think it really benefits a person when applying online unless you made a stellar first impression. I personally think that they take everyones resume and throw it in the trash after anyways because they still tell you to apply online just like everyone else would be doing if they did not attend the fair.
838,I know your feeling. This was exactly what I experienced at career fair. It's difficult to get noticed out of thousands students. The worse thing is after I apply for jobs online it's still very hard to attain an interview.
839,Hi Jack. Thanks for sharing. Specifically what processes do you plan to implement with regards to improving your time management skills? Check out this blog for some ideas that might fit your life style:  https://blog.rescuetime.com/time-management/.
840,"Muhammad Kerry has spoken to top executives at companies such as Amazon Pepsico Lockheed Martin etc. and they claim GPA isn't the end all. Are there other qualities and characteristics that you believe are being given """"too much weight"""" or are being overlooked?"
841,Pam Initially asking questions can be difficult and knowing what questions to ask is sometimes even harder. Nonetheless doing so is important. Check out the following blog which addresses how and what questions to ask clients:  https://blog.zipboard.co/key-questions-to-ask-to-your-clients-945dba30f3be.
842,Hey Muhammad thanks for sharing your story. Car rides were also a highlight of my childhood. It's always interesting to see how individuals interpret others' works and tie it back to their own experiences. Great work!
843,Good for you for overcoming your fears! I didn't do so great in my first escape room experience. But whether you succeed or fail you'll always walk away learning something about yourself and your teammates. You can always go back and try again!
844,Thanks for sharing your experience Sean! I agree that it can get frustrating at first especially when the conditions or situations aren't comfortable. It also does take time to get familiar and find your rhythm. I'm glad to hear that your team was able to make progress along the way. I encourage you to take on more challenges like this!
845,Rachel I experienced my first Escape Room with the summer interns. Like you I had expected to perform well and contribute to my team. Instead I fumbled around barking orders in an attempt to organize my teams' efforts and identify areas of individuals' expertise. Quite frankly I was a bit embarrassed by my execution of my leadership skills.  So. I compiled this list of resources related to leadership: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pBc9X4HSB00QBMsRMzg5js5TxTvOJR_6yujNITXmzH0/edit?usp=sharing
846,I enjoyed reading about your experience at the escape room especially since i was not able to attend. I specifically liked how you compare solving a room in the escape room to the workplace. I can also relate to how while working in the Launchbox there are times where it may seem as if I’m just looking at my phone. However I have been using my phone as of late to help me build a SquareSpace website. Furthermore taking some time to just think does help with generating new ideas and allows for one to gain a better direction of what to do next.
847,Maddie- thank you for sharing that resource on google docs! I was looking over some of them and it seems really helpful!
848,Luckily the good thing is that you don’t seem discouraged instead you seem motivated to perform well even more. I know sometimes while taking an easy course especially one that is online it is easy to let off and put in the least amount of effort possible and still receive an A. For me I always looked at these classes as guaranteed As as long as I put in the same amount of effort in these courses as I would for a course related to my major. Keep working hard and get a better grade.
849,I enjoyed reading about the emotions the art piece invoked from you.This also allowed me to gain more insight about your past and gave me the opportunity to compare it with my own since the piece of art I chose also made me feel nostalgic for my childhood past. Your description of the artwork was also very vivid and allowed me to picture it in my mind.
850,Thanks for sharing your experience Pam!  After reading about your failure then success I now know to ask questions and clarify details just to be safe.
851,I also felt similar at the start of the internship.  Everything seemed overwhelming but now that I have a schedule balancing the work and school isn't that bad.
852,Chloe Commend yourself for recognizing that your initial method of time management needed adjustments and for taking the initiative to implement said changes. Self-reflection self-acceptance and self-realization will serve you well in all aspects of your journey.
853,John I agree with you in regards to your ability to multi-task and execute. You've vastly grown and improved from the first two weeks. No doubt delegation can be difficult. I still struggle with this concept as well. Check out this 2-3 minute read with multiple info-graphics on the topic and importance of delegation: https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/how-to-get-better-at-delegating-and-why-you-should.
854,Jon I was glad to read that you feel settled into the internship. As far as strengths and weakness are concerned have any new ones developed or risen to the surface? Specifically what do you consider to be your strengths and weaknesses?
855,I'm glad I was able to give some of my knowledge on greek letters to help aid the group!
856,Sounds like you have figure out a way to balance your school work schedule and the program. I need to really focus on this area for myself as well!
857,Working on nine projects sounds crazy to me when I am on much less and also struggling at times to manage my time.
858,Satchel it must be frustrating to have those passions and goals for these companies only to be denied by fate money or some other reason.  I always find that acceptance is the hardest
859,Pam I really enjoyed working on that puzzle with you.  It was a wonderful albeit slightly spooky time due to the ambience; but I definitely enjoyed our surprising amount of progress in such a short time.
860,Sometimes taking the time to fix your foundation in order to improve yourself.
861,This Internship allow me to find myself and allowed me to learn more about my strengths and weakness. I'm very glad I had the opportunity to work with my fellow peers.
862,The escape room was a very fun activity to see how well you can work with your peers under a time constraint.
863,"Muhammad I agree. Failure is a profound teacher. There is a quote at Launch Box in the kitchen by Drew Houston that states Don't worry about failure. You only have to be right once."""" Check out what Will Smith had to say about failure last year.  https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/24/will-smith-failure-is-a-massive-part-of-being-able-to-be-successful.html"
864,Hi Pam. You mentioned that you would like to learn more about web development programming languages. We can certainly figure out how to incorporate that into an existing project or possibly a new one all together. Please email Kerry and I if this is of interest to you.
865,Satchel Your frustration is certainly warranted. Dedicating time and effort when it is not needed or wanted is discouraging. As far as technical skills go please feel free to have a conversation with Kerry and I with regards to how we might implement more opportunities in an existing project or a new one altogether.
866,Jack As you have discovered Slytherins aren't all bad. Slughorn Tonks and Snape are perfect examples of the unwavering loyalty that witches and wizards in this house posses. Ricky
867,"Rachel Ravenclaw seems like a perfect fit for you. Based on what I've observed thus far in the internship you definitely exhibit creative thinking problem solving and emotional intelligence. One of my favorite qualities of witch and wizards from this house is their acceptance and celebration of eccentrics. I love that Luna rocks her weirdness so well and could give """"two shakes of a worms tail"""" what others think."
868,Satchel No doubt you will be successful and the best part is YOU get to determine how to define it. (A quick 5-minute read:  https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriscarosa/2019/10/20/how-you-can-close-your-personal-success-gap/#2f3b45853ab1)
869,Ravenclaw is a great house. Are there examples of you behaving like a Ravenclaw in the past? How have you applied it into your work or personal life?
870,I agree that the quiz could be more in depth! Have you tried 16 personalities? It's not a Harry Potter quiz but it is a pretty extensive quiz that categorizes what type of person you are. And from there you can probably decide which house matches the personality best!
871,Ah yes the crowd favorite. I used to think I belonged there but am proud to say I'm a Slytherin after taking the quiz. Are there examples of you behaving like a Gryffindor in the past? How have you applied it into your work or personal life?
872,Great reflection! I enjoy the stories your shared to tie in with the house given to you. Big ups for taking pride in who you are as a person!
873,I haven't tried 16 personalities but I will now! thank you for recommending this quiz to show which house fits me the best.
874,Chloe No doubt you deserve a well earned break. Although you are not experiencing quite as much stress as in the past is there a particular approach you take when you are feeling overwhelmed?
875,John I love that you mentioned breathing as a means for coping with stress. Doing so is very powerful. When you get time check out this exercise. This site has powerful resources. https://www.mindful.org/a-five-minute-breathing-meditation/
876,John I love that you made mention of utilizing spiritual and physical (exercise) components with regards to de-stressing. How powerful! You are wise beyond your years.
877,Muhammad I absolutely love reading your posts. The emotion and self-reflective insight behind your writing is so raw and quite frankly invaluable. Would you like to talk more about your experiences with the various social groups? I'm happy to listen!
878,Pam Thanks much for sharing your methods for de-stressing. Exercise is such an important part of our overall health and well-being. Endorphins! I too use soothing music essential oils and yoga. Have you ever tried Yin Yoga? Kassandra is my favorite:  https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithkassandra
879,"Rachel Thank you for sharing such an emotionally raw post. If only we all did a little bit more of this. If I had """"answers"""" I would most definitely share them. To be honest I'm still figuring life out as well. Adult-ing is scary as hell! One beautiful lesson I am slowly starting to learn is that life is about the journey. We've spoken about this before...I wish I would have explored and taken more chances. So I admire you for """"not graduating on time"""". What does that even mean anyway!"
880,"Satchel Obviously you have identified a plethora of """"de-stressors"""" that work for you. Having options definitely is key. Would you mind sharing a bit more about the MMA training that you enjoy?"
881,Sean I love that you suggested physical activity as a means to de-stress. How right you are! Endorphins are key.
882,Yes the most common way was to talk to someone. Sometimes I called my parents for several hours and at other times I hung out with friends and have a deep talk. A sound sleep is also a way to compensate stress. I am the person who needs sound sleep everyday which makes me energetic.
883,Chloe Talking to others and getting ample rest are certainly ways to combat stress. In high school I was diagnosed with severe anxiety so I utilize a therapist in addition to family and friends. Doing so has helped tremendously.
884,Congratulations! It's completely normal to have these mixed feelings. This is a big transition in your life and you're not expected to have everything figured out! The young professional life ahead of you will be full of experiences that you will learn from. So any choice you make will help you grow as an individual in one way or another. Enjoy your big accomplishment!
885,"Jonathan Thanks for sharing your experience with regard to teamwork and its inherent importance. Can you talk to me more specifically about the """"who what where when"
886,Jonathan Kudos to you for sharing an unsuccessful communication experience coupled with a negative outcome (bad grade). How would you help to prevent this from reoccurring during your internship at Surge?
887,Rafael How right you are! In the workforce especially today's teams are more and more diverse. Making sure that each member feels as though they belong and are able to contribute is a crucial key to success. You mentioned a lack of communication among your group. Should that arise during the internship what ideas do you have for addressing such an issue?
888,Rafael Thanks for sharing this experience. I love and am impressed by the plan that ya'll put into place to efficiently and effectively handle the volume of cars. Have you ever been on a team that didn't mesh and/or work well together? If so talk to me a bit about that.
889,"Matthew As a former teacher I am in complete agreeance with your insight ...it was all apart of the learning experience for all of us."""" How right you are! In life there isn't always a correct response. Instead it is the journey that allows us to grow and develop. What a cool experience for you and the kiddos."
890,Matt Specifically how did your group address the communication issues? If this situation were to arise during the internship what approaches would you take?
891,"Sixin How right you are! Working with others allows for efficient and effective task trading for the """"greater good"""". With regard to this particular experience how did your team keep track of who was doing what and when? Did you utilize a specific method or tool?"
892,"Sixin Kudos to you for keeping your """"cool"""" and for offering an explanation."

901,"Your reflection upon this experience shows maturity that many never attain. Stepping outside your comfort zone opens the door to wonderful new life experiences.  Meeting new people who have different perspectives and backgrounds can help you become a more open-minded individual, which is a valuable attribute that will help you succeed not just as an employee, but in all aspects of your life."
902,Great to see that you are part of a group which encourages an open discussion of ideas and learning about the perspectives / views of others. I would think this is a great learning experience and a terrific way to learn to work and understand how to work with diverse groups.
903,"its great to see you get excited about the racing, but also about the technical and organizational skills that are required to make it happen.  Have you looked at the Formula SAE team as a way for experience?  its a great way to get your hands dirty, get some experience with competition, and is a real good gateway into the auto industry - including racing programs."
904,"Christina: Your academics are impressive!  Beyond your GPA, your being an Engineering Ambassador will serve you well.  It took me a LONG time to learn what you already must know, that being that engineers who can communicates have far more value than those who cannot.  The EA program that Dr. Thole created is a shining example of communicating for engineering good so kudos to you for embracing that program.  Another beyond academic attribute that the Volvo Group supports is Women in Engrg."

908,"Hi Jack,

Communication is one of the key elements to success in professional world. At Siemens we offer multiple development programs where you will be fully integrated into a team working to solve global problems. You will not only need to communicate with colleagues locally but in some cases around the world. Solid communication and teamwork is one of the key drivers to Siemens success."
909,"Hi Christina,

Getting to know your teammates in a setting outside of work, school or lab can be very beneficial. It builds stronger relationships and increases trust. At Siemens we have development programs which allow you to grow relationship professionally but also personally with the members of your cohort and with previous classes of your development program."
910,Leading by example is a great way to demonstrate leadership ability. Being passionate about the sport and being driven to do well allowed you to set a postive example for fellow team members to follow suit.
911,"This sounds like such a wonderful experience in learning how to serve others. And, this type of experience gives you a better understanding of what it means to be a business person who creates positive impacts in their community. I'm thinking how this experience plays into the idea of Corporate Social Responsibility for organizations and how you already have an idea of what it means for a company to be socially responsible."
912,Giving back to one's community is so important. It is great that you take the time out of your schedule to give back to members or aspects of the community. This is a good foundation to have as you enter into working for a business or organization where companies also have the ability to make positive impacts on their surrounding communities.
913,"Hands-on experience is often one of the best teachers. It shows initiative on your part to seek out an internship opportunity, especially in a new environment (hotel), as well as trying to solve problems on your own before going to a manager. This experience of learning-through-doing seemed to be beneficial to you in your understanding of working with others who come from different backgrounds and perspectives."
914,"Having the opportunity to participate in an event like this helps build your creative thinking skills, as well as develop teamwork skills. You should definitely be proud of your work! The more you experience activities like this the more you'll be pushed to think in new ways, build confidence in your presentation skills, as well as expand your industry connections through networking."
915,"In addition to knowing what you want to do, knowing how to get there is just as as important. It's great that you have found something which you are so evidently passionate about. Having a plan to seek out educational and experiential opportunities, like you've done, will help you in reaching your goals."
916,"I'm glad you had the opportunity to show others a part of your culture and you should feel proud of the work you put into this event. This experience shows you that we often need to be patient with ourselves and with our work. Though we live in a culture that is very much driven by 'busyness' and getting things done as quickly as possible, your experience here shows that taking time, putting forth effort, and really trying produces a positive result."
917,"Being able to influence others to create positive change is a wonderful skill to have. This shows you are able to organize events, understand fundraising, and care about the environment. Hopefully you'll be able to initiate these same skills and interests in your work environment to help your place of work consider their own impact on the environment."
918,"As a fellow Zeta, I'm always pleased to see ZTA continually being one of the top fundraising Greek organizations at Penn State. The opportunities to get involved in one's Greek organization are numerous and will serve you well in developing leadership roles and decision-making skills."
919,"Seeking out experiences like this can lead you to areas of work that you hadn't considered before. Plus, it is beneficial in building your networking connections. Being wiling to expand on your curiosity by actually trying or doing things will help guide you in your decision  making process in the future."
920,"Seeking out opportunities like this allows you to engage in an area of work that you may not have seriously considered before. Plus, trying new things, and getting certifications like this, can give you an edge over other individuals when looking for future internships or employment."
921,"What positive thinking and action on your end! It can take courage to 'go against the flow', especially if you feel you are being treated differently due to gender, race, sexual orientation, etc. Keep being empowered by who you are and you will continue to be a powerful example to the women you work with."
922,"Being curious and seeking out connections with others will definitely work to your advantage. By experiencing new opportunities you may come across a part of the industry that you never considered working in. Keep making connections, going on available trips, and staying curious!"
923,One of the under-appreciated aspects of interning outside of your home town is that it can give you a better idea of where would be an ideal place to live after school. It sounds like you had a fantastic experience!
924,Great reflection! It seems like this was a memorable experience where you learned to adapt yourself to a different culture and communicate with people from different background.
925,"This was amusing to read! Sometimes you have to serve customers who know the product better, or at least have their own biases about it. At any rate, I would recommend taking HM 411 Beverage Management if you expect to encounter similar scenarios in your future career."
926,"Beaver Stadium is really unlike any other place in the world. Hours of driving through PA with nothing but small towns, and then you see one of the biggest stadiums in the world in what seems like the middle of nowhere. Even if there are so many thousands of people at every game, going there is an experience unique to you as a Penn State student."
927,Making connections like this one are so important in the industry. By taking the initiative to apply for this position you have set yourself ahead of others who may have looked at the qualifications and not applied. You now have your 'foot in the door' by having networked and made a contact at the company. Keep taking the initiative and it will pay off!
928,What a unique experience in order to develop your problem solving and adaptability skills! This experience shows your leadership ability as well as taking initiative to make things happen.
929,"Sometimes what seems like the scariest experiences can lead to the most rewarding ones! Being able to adapt to new situations is important and it sounds like you were able to make the most of your situation, learn, and grow!"
930,"Monica - it's great that you were able to recognize the importance of learning the strengths/skills of your teammates. In both the collegiate and (especially) the professional world, it's essential that you are able to quickly and effectively identify the strengths/weaknesses with those you are working with - whether they be your employees, peers, or senior to you. Another key is to be able to leverage those insights into making good decisions about team structure, communications, and tasks."
931,"Jordan - time constraints are never fun! You get plenty of practice with individual time management in college, but it was nice to see you being in a situation where you all were dependent on each other, and had to use your communication and leadership skills to ensure you stayed on track. This is very representative of the working world, where you almost always are depending on work from other to complete your tasks, or someone is depending on you. Clear communication is crucial."
932,"Manuel - good insight about being assertive and owning the interview. You definitely want to be an active participant. Also remember that an interview is just as much about finding out whether the company is a good fit for YOU, as it is them finding out if you'll be a good fit for that company. Be prepared, do your """"homework"""" on the company, and have meaningful, intelligent questions that make your interviewer think. Doing so can help show how well you think, while giving you useful information."
933,"I am happy that you now include travelling in your set of interests. Visiting new places and being curious about new cultures and people is an excellent asset for working in the hospitality field. Plus, you can use your own travel experiences as a topic of conversation so as to better connect with guests, and as an ice breaker in social situations to ask about the travel experiences of others. Travel on!!!"
934,Hi Monica! Your resume is looking good. May I recommend elaborating more on the skills you acquired during your internship? Tell me more about how you clarified internal medicine procedures. Describe your role in the treatment reviews. You may consider writing a story on your board about the internship and what skills you acquired to help organizations understand your skills sets more.
935,"Hi Nina, your resume highlights a lot of exposure and skills from your internship - great job at sharing these details and keep up the great work with the dean's list! A recommendation for your resume is to capture any additional interests, activities, clubs or additional languages you speak."
936,"Grant - Good reflection. As you continue group work throughout the rest of your time at Penn State and in other endeavors, consider the positives and negatives of strictly defined roles and goals. Can you think of an experience you have had where you were unable to step out of a defined role that limited you from experiences? Have you ever worked in a group that set goals that were too feasible to start with, thereby limiting the groups potential?"
937,"Natalie - Great observations and connections with the activity and plans for SHO Time moving forward. You mentioned that you believe that trust is the most important skill when it comes to making a team effective. How do you feel trust is built effectively within a team? How does the trust you have among a team you work with for a project differ from the trust you have in your friends? Is there a certain level of trust that needs to be reached within a group? If so, how is that level determined,"
938,"Alex - Nice job focusing on our discussion of the unexpected issues arising during the course of SHO Time, such as a student being unable to attend certain events. You mention that even if a scholar is unable to attend events, SHO Time is important in that it helps foster inter-student relationships through substantial conversation. How would you ensure that a student who, for one reason or another, is unable to attend certain events? How will you ensure that despite physically not being at cert"
939,Joe - Great job referencing your experiences in your first-year CAS class. You mentioned the organizational meeting your team had towards the end of the project in order to iron out key details that needed to be addressed in order to make progress. How do you create the same kind of pressure artificially 5 weeks before a project is due? What role does getting to know the people with whom you are working serve in that meeting? Would assigning roles too early be detrimental to the creativity of th
940,"Sneha - Nice job referencing your experience in Engineering Design 100H. You mentioned how you were able get to know and understand the individuals within the group you worked with more over the course over the semester. However, the main portion of SHO Time is much more condensed. How would you approach misunderstandings or conflicts between your mentees? How will you allow them the chance to get to learn more about one another."
941,"Marisa - Thank you for sharing your previous experiences of working in groups. In SHO Time, plenty of the work is delegated for the mentors. However, there are certainly opportunities to go beyond what is asked of you. How will you balance your contributions to SHO Time while ensuring that you are allotting the appropriate amount of time to your group and to yourself?"
942,"Alex - Nice job focusing on our discussion of the unexpected issues arising during the course of SHO Time, such as a student being unable to attend certain events. You mention that even if a scholar is unable to attend events, SHO Time is important in that it helps foster inter-student relationships through substantial conversation. How would you ensure that for a student who, for one reason or another, is unable to attend certain events?"
943,"Good reflection Alex! SHO Time features a lot of different events that different types of students tend to be more comfortable with. What will you do to make sure that all students gain the most of each event for their own personal growth? To what degree is it necessary to alter the """"plan"""" to aid certain students and to what degree is it necessary to try to push students outside their comfort zones?"
944,"Thank you for participating so much in our group discussion. Your fresh, comical insights kept our committee's time on Old Main Lawn fun and lively. Remember these observed interactions when SHO Time arrives this fall, as many freshman will be nervous trying to impress others and gauge others investment levels in newfound relationships!"
945,"Thank you Carolyn! This is a great point to remember come SHO Time this August. While we cannot force our mentees to put away their phones, we can encourage them to stay involved in their immediate surroundings, as the relationships they make during SHO Time will remain with them for the rest of their lives at PSU!"
946,"Thank you for sharing your Personal Mission Statement, Tessa. It is clear that you are very motivated to have an impact on others and to give yourself the opportunity to grow and learn new things. As we move towards SHO Time consider what you will do to create an environment that lends itself for other students to be open about their goals and share their aspirations for their time at Penn State?"
947,"Natalie, this was a very well-written post. I can see that you thought deeply on the topic of teamwork and its connections to SHO TIME. The few days of SHO TIME will be extremely busy and can definitely be stressful. Having strong teamwork prior to and during those days will be crucial to both the success of the events and to the enjoyment of the incoming students. I completely agree with you about trust. It really is an indispensable skill in any work setting or other life event."
948,"Alex, I really enjoyed how you provided a specific example where maintaining the relationship is key: when a mentee isn't able to make an event. It's very likely that can happen. Like you said, SHO TIME is meant to foster the relationships among the incoming students. Having that dialogue with a student who may be unable to attend an event is crucial to developing the mentor-mentee relationship. We should all be aware of keeping such connections as they can really improve any students' time."
949,"Alex, I completely agree with your post. There are times when a student may not feel included in the activities for many reasons. You make a strong point: that being a Schreyer Scholar implies that you have what it takes to improve other lives. We all have what it takes. If, for example, an incoming student does seem to be shy, I suggest we try and nudge them a little bit. We shouldn't push them too far out of their comfort zones, but small nudges here or there would help them enjoy it all."
950,"Joe, I really enjoyed reading the specific experience you had with group interactions and teamwork. I could not agree more on the stress you place on effective communication and early defining of roles within groups. Having such in place won't be all that is necessary to succeed, but they will surely set any group on the right foot. That's why we have so many meetings throughout the semester planning out the details for SHO TIME and making sure everyone is updated on each others' roles."
951,"Joe, I really enjoyed reading your observations on the HUB Lawn. We sure did see a lot of activities going on around us during our discussion. I recall you telling us about your experience with the CHEM 457 project. You mentioned how it was hard to get the project started due to the other members all being seniors with jobs already. I can definitely understand the struggle there. During SHO TIME, I feel that we should all be mindful of getting planning done early to reduce any possible stress."
952,"Marisa, it was a pleasure reading your previous experiences and how you learned from them. I can closely relate to how you felt when you were younger. Being a leader does not mean that you're constantly """"nice"""" to everyone. Sometimes, like you said, it is necessary to get your point across and be a bit more harsh. In SHO TIME, most of the work should be delegated nicely but if it's necessary to do so, don't be afraid to let your voice be heard!"
953,"Marissa, that's a great observation! I really enjoyed how you structured your post and could not agree more with the common denominator you mentioned. People interacted with each other positively because they felt comfortable where they were. In SHO TIME, as leaders, we should all strive to do just that. Make sure everyone is comfortable wherever they are during the orientation. It'll be just like a HUB Lawn."
954,"Grant, great job relating key ideas with each other. Problem solving and teamwork revolves around every single moment of our lives and really is a crucial skill to possess anywhere. I like how related it to a personal experience - your research lab. During SHO TIME, communication, problem solving, teamwork, and many other leadership skills all will factor into the success of the orientation. We should all try out best to display those skills as much as possible."
955,"Sneha, I really enjoyed how you referenced your Engineering Design 100H course. I'm sure it must have been difficult for you and your team members to function together at such a different part of your lives - college. We should keep in mind that the incoming students for SHO TIME will be experiencing the exact same thing. They are all transitioning to a different stage of their lives and may be overridden with emotions. That and, like you said, being honest with others will help a great deal."
956,"Tessa, I really enjoyed reading about your passions and thoughts. I definitely agree with all your points on how creativity, relationships, learning, and experiences are all critical components in life. All of those will help ensure we keep growing as people and evolve to adapt to certain situations. It's very similar to SHO TIME. During the few days of orientation, we need to keep in mind we are still growing and learning. We may make mistakes, but we should always make sure to learn from them."
957,"I'm so glad that you enjoyed our day, Marisa!  It's really funny to see that as unique as we all are, our status as Penn State students does give us that shared enjoyment of some pretty classic Penn State attractions.  I'll be interested to see how the group develops throughtout the summer and if the people you pegged as leaders and supporters early on stick to that role - I personally think you're all great leaders!"
958,"Ceci, your post is making me miss State College more than I already do!  I definitely agree that, with more time, we could have made our day even more perfect.  I personally think it would be awesome if our group could get together another time and do some of those other things you mentioned (especially the Pokey Sticks!), but you're right- what you do isn't as important as who you do it with!"
959,"I think it's so nice that you took the extra time to appreciate one more perfect aspect of the day: your perfect milkshake!  It really is those little things that can turn a good day into a perfect day, and I don't think people stop to recognize those things as often as they should.  And, like you said, the weather is another one of those """"little things""""... I could definitely go for a beautiful day on Old Main lawn right now!"
960,"I also finished my first visit to Penn State with a trip to the Creamery!  It really is incredible to think that it's been 3 years since that first visit and that this once strange place is now as familiar to me as my own hometown.  Funny that something as simple as ice cream can serve as a reminder of change, hard work, and the excitement and fulfillment that comes with growing up!"
961,"What an action packed day, Jamie!  I think the inclusion of a Penn State sporting event is a really awesome choice because those events tend to exemplify some of Penn State's most central values, like hard work, perseverance, and community.  Plus, there's nothing quite like joining tens of thousands of fans in a chant or a song during a close football game!"
962,"You're definitely right, Danielle, that our perfect day was probably the break everyone was needing right before finals week.  I know that, for me, it's really important to take a step back from the stress of school and remind myself that there's more to life than work.  Thankfully, spending time with friends can be one of the best ways to do that, just like we did!"
963,"I think it's interesting that you repeatedly mention bonding as a team throughout your reflection.  While it's true that we went out of our way to visit some classic Penn State landmarks, I think you're right that what's more important is that it gave us the opportunity to get to know everyone a little better.  I hope that everyone feels like our Perfect Day made us a stronger team that is ready to take on SHO TIME 2016!"
964,I bet Penn State outsiders would be amazed to see that we were able to fit so much excitement into just one day!  It's truly a testament to the rich and exciting atmosphere of State College and the adventure-seeking attitudes of the students who live there.  I hope we can still find some more exciting things to do to bond with our committee come August!
965,"Casey, I think this mission statement is a great way to look at things. Focusing on developing skills outside the classroom is a very important part of college, and it's important not to lose sight of that. A lot of fields look at the different experiences someone has when considering them for an internship and the like. I do want to warn you though that focusing solely on grades is a slippery slope. Focus on improving yourself, and the good grades will come."
966,"It's funny that something as simple as getting ice cream can be an opportunity for reflection (and that it can turn strangers into friends!).  As you mentioned, the personalities of our group seem to blend well together, which I think makes us an even stronger team.  Here's to hoping all of our decisions go so smoothly (and include more ice cream) once August comes!"
967,"I think one of the most important parts of this is the fact that you've figured out how to apply this mission statement to more than just your career or some form of professional development. One of the best ways to develop these sorts of mentalities like you're talking about is to live it (no pun intended). Sometimes the best way to make a difference is to just lend a hand, and I can see that you're already great at that."
968,"Spencer, I really like your mission statement's overt goal to inspire and motivate others. I feel like that alone is something that we're looking for and hoping for in a SHOTIME mentor. I would like to see in one of these reflections a discussion on how you specifically are improving yourself. Have you been getting that coveted 4.0? Or are you just doing a little extra each day. Either one is commendable for its own reasons, and I can't wait to see what you do."
969,"Kokila, I find it great that you're working on finding balance between our two goals of improving yourself and improving the world. I think these two goals tend to go hand in hand, but being able to separate them and work individually is admirable. I think the idea of soul searching to find yourself is an important one to have, and it's definitely one that should be shared with the SHOTIME students."
970,"A cool part about your mission statement is that you want to keep for those who don't have the same experiences as you what others did for you. It's definitely the kind of skill set that we need in SHOTIME, and maybe it's the sort of thing that we need in life. I'm sure the students who are under you will appreciate the guidance that you can offer."
971,"It's great that you mention developing closer personal relationships. Many people forget how important that is to personal health. It's also an important skill in these pivotal years of school. Those sorts of relationships are exactly the type of thing that is important for SHOTIME mentors, as we want to make sure the mentors and the students have a great relationship that they can rely on for the rest of their time at Penn State."
972,"I think an important part of this is your focus on integrity and passion. I'm sure there's a fortune cookie somewhere that says if you combine those two, anything can be done. but it's true. That's the type of determination that that can make dreams come true. I also like that you keep your goals open. You might not be 100% on what they are, but you know you'll strive very hard at them."
973,"Hey Akshil, I really like this mission statement, because you focus on not only your academic and professional developments, but also your personal life. It's sometimes difficult to think about your personal life in your surely busy professional life, but it will always be important to think about your family and friends."
974,"Emily, I really like that you're always trying to challenge yourself by filling your life with different activities. Learning to better yourself and also being aware of your accomplishments is very important. Keep doing what you're doing and I'm sure you'll go far in life!"
975,"Gabby, I really like your motivation in writing this personal mission statement. The fact that you are telling yourself that you """"will"""" succeed in accomplishing your goals is a sure sign that you are very passionate about your goals and accomplishments. I wish you the best in doing everything you can at Penn State and in the future!"
976,"Kokila, you're totally right that creating a mission statement is hard! I really like what you have set as your mission statement, because it seems to encompass everything there is from personal to professional life. I personally think it's really important that you have a balance between your personal and professional lives, and it's great that you are also trying to strike that balance."
977,"Hey Raza, I think it's really great that you look to your peers and other people. Using your mentors around you correctly is a very good skill to have, and learning from these people will make sure that you similarly succeed!"
978,"Nicole, it's really great that you want to help people overseas, and it's even better that you're passionate about it! One of the most important things in life is to find something that you are truly passionate about, because that way you can live your life in a way that's both meaningful to you and useful for the rest of society. Best wishes to your dreams of working in a global environment!"
979,"Spencer, I really like your mission statement because it shows your own efforts in welcoming diversity in your life, both ideologically and practically. Many people are not as open minded as you are, so it's great to see someone making such an effort to improve themselves!"
980,"Madisyn, I really like how you are putting a global perspective into your mission statement. Something like a mission trip can really change how we see the world, and I can see that you definitely used your mission trip to South Africa as a source of your motivation!"
981,"Mike, we all have something to bring to the table, and it's great that you're recognizing your own skills to bring and using them to help the world as much as you can. Someone like you with the willingness to help people are important in society to help the world grow stronger!"
982,"Alex, your mission statement is so simple and powerful. I definitely do agree about how people will try to avoid showing their passions, and these people will find it hard to make it far in life simply because you need to be passionate about what you're doing to succeed in it. I wish you the best in pursuing your passions!"
983,"David, I definitely agree with you that you should always lead by example, and it's really great that you want to be that example for people to follow. Your mission statement shows that you're very motivated to improve yourself, and I think that's a really good quality!"
984,"Kavya, your focus on hard work on dedication shows me that you are a truly motivated individual. I'm glad that you are doing something that you are truly passionate about, because a lot of people don't have that figured out yet."
985,"It's so awesome to hear that you were able to go to a school that means so much to you and your family.  I often find myself feeling a little jealous of those students who come from a Penn State family because I think it really brings people closer when they are able to share that sense of community.  It can be a little tough to try to make outsiders understand how special some of the things that go on here are, so I'm glad that you have people close to you who can appreciate it all with you!"
986,"Great insight on the similarities and agreements of each mentor's """"perfect day!"""" The constancy made for a natural and enjoyable bonding experience. The planning stage might have been slightly more difficult had disagreements occurred, but I'm sure the excellent leaders of the group would have found a compromise regardless."
987,"Building relationships is most definitely important! I like how you mentioned the simple respect and kindness. Getting to know new people doesn't need to be a complicated experience. In fact, even if you know nothing about a person, simply starting with respect and kindness is the best way to get off on the right foot and build a strong network."
988,Great comment on the necessity to occasionally escape from the stress in the life of a student! Sometimes you just need to step back and enjoy the company of the people around you. Breaks from studying can actually improve your learning and improve your overall studying efficiency!
989,Sounds like an enjoyable day! It's easy to find common ground and make new friends with such classic Penn State activities. I'm sure you're able to reflect on the lessons you learned and the sense of community that you built on this perfect day.
990,"Susan,

I really liked all of your selections and the insight that you put into each one of them. I especially liked the painting about the rocks: it can be hard to stand out but being confident yourself and not being afraid to be unique is crucial to developing yourself. Great job!"
991,"Cara,

I really like the """"Modern Limits"""" painting and I think it perfectly captures the experience that a lot of us had when we first transitioned to Penn State. Being able to break down this large and complex experience into smaller parts is the only way we can manage it, and I think it's great that you were able to recognize that and find a painting that matched that idea."
992,"Cara,

I really liked your selection of the """"Modern Limits"""" and your analysis of it. I think that idea reflects how a lot of us feel when we transitioned to college, especially coming to a school as large as Penn State. Being able to break down this huge experience into more manageable pieces as you mentioned is a crucial skill to be able to adjust and transition well. Great work!"
993,"I would have to agree with you about the football, Zach!  I too have very little interest in football itself, yet, every year, I find myself buying a season ticket because I can't get enough of the atmosphere.  I think I said this on someone else's reflection as well, but Penn State football really does exemplify the incredible sense of community that exists on this campus and among its alumni."
994,"I love the Arboretum! I went there for the first time this spring and I've spent quite a good deal of time there this summer. I grew up in the woods, doing nature camps and hiking and whatnot too so it really is a slice of childhood. Good reflection, maybe you could take your SHO TIME group there in the fall!"
995,I love seeing both sides of this story(I read Sumit's earlier). I'm sure those communication skills will come in handy come SHO TIME! I'm excited for the Brain Show because I'm sure that the whip and nae-nae will make an appearance. Great work! Keep up the good posts!
996,"Sounds interesting! I would love to hear more about World in Conversation - I've never heard of it before. It's really cool that you know some Chinese, knowing another language is scientifically proven to alter how you think. Good work."
997,I'm glad that you bonded a bit with your fellow mentors! A strong mentor network is imperative to the success of SHO TIME. I actually could use some snapchat tricks because I still have some of those hidden trophies left to get and I can't figure out how to achieve them. The dancing sounds interesting too! I definitely want to see it in the fall!
998,"Hey mentee! I'm glad that you connected with some other mentors, it'll be good to know your fellow mentors in the fall. I need you to teach me how to dance, I'm hopeless on the dance floor. I'm so proud of you for becoming a mentor this year and I know you'll do great things with my grand-mentees!"
999,It's cool seeing this experience from three different sides. I'm really glad you three got to know each other better. Hopefully we'll have a lot of interesting snapchat filters for you and your mentees to bond over come SHO TIME! Cool post!
1000,"I love how you made all those connections just by playing """"I Spy"""". Really cool! I'm glad you had this experience. I hope your summer has been full of good weather and a nice and light workload. Can't wait to see what memories your group makes come fall!"
1001,"Teamwork makes the dream work! We can learn much from others, especially those with knowledge and experience. SHO Time mentors should be like the veteran male cheerleaders you saw on Old Main, teaching and showing the incoming freshman how to succeed at Penn State and beyond."
1002,"I've been reading a lot of these mission statements and I'm glad that yours includes """"resilience."""" An important part of self development and discovering who you are is to work hard and be good regardless of what is happening in your life, and it's great that you recognize that."
1003,"I notice that a lot of your mission statement overlaps with the ideals of the SHC, which I think is fantastic. Either you had these ideals before and you found the best place possible to develop them or you have been inspired enough by them that you've taken them on yourself. If the latter is true, then you'll be great at instilling those values to new students."
1004,"Passion is arguably the most important part of any mission statement. Regardless of the goals of integrity and of global perspective, without passion, there is no development made out of the  mission statement. I'm happy that you've identified that in your life as well."
1005,"I like that your mission statement doesn't work in generics like """"I will develop."""" You've set goals (such as being challenged) and obviously by being a SHOTIME mentor, you're working toward those challenges. I can't wait to see what these develop into."
1006,"I think the best part of this is that you're clearly doing your best now to make the world a better place. Obviously, what you're studying can be developed into something incredible useful. But, what's most important is that you live this mission statement in your day to day life with your interactions with friends and family."
1007,"I envy your ability to appreciate art! I unfortunately have trouble relating to artwork in the same way.  But we need people like you to continue the appreciation of art, especially considering the emphasis on STEM fields and the subsequent pull away from the humanities. I noticed you are a chemical engineering major, however, and it seems like you have the perfect balance! Keep doing what you're doing."
1008,"It's good to have a space at school where you can feel comfortable and maybe even """"at home."""" My family used to go camping once a year together and I miss that time spent enjoying with them. I unfortunately haven't found my own space but I guess I'll have to check out the arboretum sometime soon! I haven't explored it too much but I have enjoyed lying in the grass all the way in the back. A little bit of sun is healthy! Finding a way to destress is also very healthy."
1009,"People watching is one of my favorite things to do - you learn so much about human behavior! It is especially interesting to do so at an airport. You see such a huge range of emotions! I'm happy to hear that you are constantly thinking about your leadership role, and I'm sure that will be very useful once SHO TIME starts. I'm excited to hear about your success as a mentor and about how your relationship with your mentees develops."
1010,"I really enjoyed the second painting you chose. I laughed a bit to myself because I've felt like that horse on more than one occasion. I feel like every day I find a challenge that I don't want to face - whether big or small. I watched a TED talk once (I can't remember what it was called) and something the woman said really stuck out to me: """"If you wait until you want to do something, you're never going to do it."""" I try to remind myself that I have to create my own motivation."
1011,"I can absolutely relate to your second painting choice. I had no final exams during finals week, but I had an insane amount of work leading up to that week. Several presentations, papers, and graded assignments. Time management is definitely the hardest but most valuable thing I've learned since I started school at Penn State."
1012,"This sounds like an incredible undertaking! I've never worked in business or management, but I do have experience promoting things. This year I founded the first annual high school tournament for the PSU Mock Trial Association. Getting something like that off the ground is tough work, so I appreciate the effort you are describing and I congratulate you on your success! This type of work ethic is what we need to make this year's SHO TIME a success!"
1013,"Riley, well done in your work to manage such a group.  You have an insight into what the moderators for the presidential debates are going through, albeit they have 2 participants  compared to your 17. One huge skill you built through this was facilitation.  The ability to manage, align and progress with a large group is something of value to any future endeavor.  Kudos and check out this link from Brown University for more thoughts on facilitation: http://bit.ly/1QkLIkd"
1014,"Good example of how you showed leadership in a situation when you weren\'t \""""appointed\"""" the leader.  It\'s these situations where you really need to use leadership skills to bring a group together to accomplish a task."
1015,"You managed to reflect on all three of the suggested choices in a succinct paragraph.  I can see a future interviewer who might see this post asking you more about these works of art, so keep them in mind in the future.  I also hope you will go back and visit the Palmer in the future and be further inspired."
1016,"\""""brought out leadership qualities\"""" - do you have enough characters in the posting to elaborate on this just a bit?  Also...\""""I will be able to volunteering more...\""""  the grammar isn\'t quite right here, so if it\'s not too hard, you might want to correct."
1017,I hope you get to go on more mission trips with some groups at PSU.  There are numerous groups that do various missions around both the US and the world (often at Spring break as well.)
1018,What a great learning experience and an excellent way to showcase both hard and soft skills you have developed.  I especially like that you were able to include a small collage photo of the event
1019,"Great reflections on our visit to the museum.  Wouldn\'t it be fun if a future interviewer saw this and asked you about these works of art and to explain a bit more about what they mean to you?  With that in mind, you might want to do a quick proof-read of your reflection.  There are a few typos/spelling/grammar errors that I think you\'ll find if you read over it.  One is \""""inner\"""" child.  It seems the Sarah Bernhardt spoke to many in our class!"
1020,"Great reflections on our visit to the museum. Wouldn\'t it be fun if a future interviewer saw this and asked you about these works of art and to explain a bit more about what they mean to you? I think your connection to the \""""take root\"""" piece is so true for many college students. It seems the Sarah Bernhardt spoke to many in our class!"
1021,"Courtney- Thanks for sharing your experience helping your teammates. As an HDFS major, you will definitely use emotional intelligence and teamwork in your future. I\'m a fifth year graduate student in HDFS, and if you are looking for research or other opportunities in HDFS, I would be happy to help (eaw237@psu.edu)."
1022,"It\'s great that you found a niche at Penn State after a rough start. Have you had any experiences in Gamma Sigma Sigma or in other clubs that are related to your major, Athletic Training? You\'ll gain valuable skills in all your experiences at PSU, and it\'s always good to find some experiences that are related to your major, too."
1023,"Samantha- It\'s great that you want to join many clubs and organizations! It makes college more fun and you will build valuable connections, like you describe below. Definitely update us on experiences you have had in addition to Sorority Recruitment now that the semester is in full swing!"
1024,"Your wording can be improve in the beginning of this post. \""""I developed the soft skill of self-awareness since i could look back on my actions\"""" is an awkward sentence. Very wordy too. There isn\'t much flow to this post. You jump from family hiking story to your brother\'s leadership skill at Penn State. Try to focus on the flow of your post next entry. I like at the end you talk about one of your leadership skills. However, I think you should consider revising this post."
1025,"This is a great post that could use a little of tweaking with word choice. Other than that I like how you connected the nature in the arboretum to the story when you were 10yrs old. You chose the perfect soft skill of \""""curiosity\""""."
1026,This is a great post about how you apply the things you learned in this event. I agree that social media has taken away from our privacy but it is how you let it is the key. Mediating how much you put on social media is a great skill to develop in order to promote the best Image of yourself. If there is any chance you can add more to this post i would put how this experience mode you specifically in a professional setting.
1027,"One of my favorite cheesy sayings is \""""a whole is greater than the sum of its parts!\"""" It definitely applies here: with the support of the other women, you were able to do do things that you wouldn\'t have on your own. I also suggest adding \'teamwork\' as a skill tag.
I\'m glad you see the value in leaving your comfort zone- in my opinion, it\'s the best way to learn about yourself. Make this a habit and you\'ll keep growing as a person!"
1028,"Hannah- I\'m glad you could learn so much in just one weekend! 

I believe that the best kind of leader is adaptable. In this case, if nobody had stepped up to develop the plan, would you have? However, it\'s great that you recognized your natural leadership role. 

Here\'s my favorite article on the topic: it gives concrete actions to become a more well-rounded leader.  http://www.championshipcoachesnetwork.com/public/385.cfm"
1029,"Alaina, here\'s a story for you: when I was younger I was pretty shy, but now my friends know me as \""""SO good at meeting people.\"""" I now love talking to strangers and going to events alone- it\'s the best way to meet new people! Plus, making new connections will make your career and life much better. 

As I found, this is something that comes with practice. Set a benchmark for yourself to have a conversation with someone new each day. You\'ll learn some interesting things, and it\'ll become a habit."
1030,"Your first sentence made my day- at Live It, we\'re based on the power that reflection has to create personal change! I encourage you to post more entries reflecting on life experiences.

Have you thought about how leadership and reflection work together? The best leaders constantly seek improvement: using what they learn through reflection, they alter their thoughts and behaviors to become more effective."
1031,"Nicely written succinct explanation for all three of your choices. Think about how you might respond if an interviewer saw this and asked about your wanting to be the \""""best of the best\"""", but the job requires much collaborative teamwork. You are correct that you need to be at the top of your class to enter Athletic Training, but you might need to think about and explain how you can achieve that and still be a great team player."
1032,You\'ve done a nice job of explaining how you developed some teamwork skills and how you would use them in a business.  I believe these skills will be critical even if you end up working for someone else rather than starting your own business.
1033,Interesting and succinct description of your chosen artwork that really shows some deeper thinking on your part as well as letting a bit of your personality and values shine through.  Good explanation of how this painting reflects your experiences with the Four Diamonds fund.
1034,"Liza, this sounds like a very rewarding experience and use of your time.  It sounds like you differentiated to meet the needs of each learner which is key to rapid learning growth.  Some folks would have goofed off without the lead teacher being in the room so cheers to your initiative.  I would encourage you to think of more events where you should initiative and put them on Live It to allow instructors, mentors, and recruiters to see your hard work. Feel free to reach out: dknicely@liveitu.com"
1035,"Melanie, I\'m so glad you shared this experience as it truly captures a great opportunity from your high school work that translates clearly to college and beyond.  I also served as a student council member in my high school and actually gave the keynote for our graduation.  It was rewarding and required the skill tags you identified here.  These skills will continue to pay dividends as you head into your career.  I certainly used these skills when I worked for Hilton hotels."
1036,"Zach, this is a great post to show how you were able to tame multiple tasks at one time.  Your ability to partner with other individuals and agencies will certainly be a cornerstone for you in the finance field.  Do you see yourself continuing down the entrepreneurial path of building a brand via management or do you plan to push into a standard financial position?  Feel free to reach out via email dknicely@liveitu.com."
1037,"Camila, Possessing initiative skills are essential to becoming a leader. I am glad you shared this experience, it really shows the initiative you take in projects and how strongly you feel about them. This is a great attitude to have!  I think you should definitely add Teamwork as a skill tag in place of innovation."
1038,"This is a great reflection on which pieces are of art you connected most with. However, I suggest maybe just sticking with on piece of art per post, It feels like you connect most with Peacock Blue and Yellow Seaform Set with Yellow Lip Wraps. To better your skills in critical thinking, you can put yourself in a situation where it involves this skill. The best way to strengthen and further develop is by doing!"
1039,"I can relate to you on this one, You really hit the nail on the head. I think this post really encapsulates what you have learned as far as how to solve your attention span problem. I think you could further increase your conflict resolution skill by reading this article: http://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/conflict-resolution.html."
1040,"Wow, you did a lot for your team!!! This is a great description of how you used and developed your leadership skills. To further strengthen your leadership skills I highly suggest participating in another sport at Penn State, if you aren\'t already. If you get involved in any of the sports, even if you are not a team captain, you can still work on your leadership skills in a way that you seem to love!"
1041,"Hi Cara! You will use teamwork almost everyday of your life and through this reflections, you\'ve shown that you understood the importance of this skill. I would also recommend that you consider other skills that you have developed in the process. \'Risk Taking\' or \'Adaptability\' could also fit in this post as you described conquering your fear at a young age. Keep it up!"
1042,Thanks for sharing your experience! The Arboretum is a great example of how community service can make an impact on society. I would suggest you find new ways to contribute to your community. Penn State offers opportunities at http://volunteer.psu.edu/. You can also find service organizations at http://clubs.psu.edu.
1043,"Great reflection, Yoonsuk! The great thing about art is that any concept can be interpreted in several different ways, especially when the viewers come from different backgrounds and perspectives. In the digital age, more and more companies are hiring teams overseas to work together. Possessing intercultural skills is imperative in this generation to be able to communicate with people of other cultures. Keep it up!"
1044,"That is a pretty good connection to circle back to opening your own business. Your teamwork skill ties in well with the idea of a start-up in the future. If you are really interested in opening a business in the future, the best way to get in that business mindset is by listening to successful persons like Tony Robinson, Robert Kiyosaki, and Napoleon Hill. I highly suggest either listening to or reading the book \""""Think and Grow Rich\"""" by Napoleon Hill."
1045,"I think you did really well reflecting on the Shaver\'s Creek experience. You really encapsulated your leadership skill development well. I think that you should try joining other leadership groups, activities, or even an honor societies within Penn State to further increase your knowledge of leadership skills and how to be an even better leader! Here is the Penn State organization search to help find the organization that\'s perfect for you https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/hub/studentorgs/orgdirect"
1046,"It was interesting to see that you broke out of your shell, that is definitely a step in the right direction! I would really like to see more posts about your developing leadership experiences. I highly suggest looking through Penn State\'s organizations to find one that best suits your hobbies and can help you develop your leadership skills. Here is the link to find organizations that will suit you! https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/hub/studentorgs/orgdirectory/search.aspx"
1047,"Jill, great reflection! As a past canner, I too had learned so much from the experience. You can learn qualities about yourself when engaging with the community. If you\'re looking for new ways to get involved, Penn State offers opportunities at http://volunteer.psu.edu/. You can also find service organizations at http://clubs.psu.edu. Keep it up!"
1048,Thanks for sharing your experiences! Having a sense of self-awareness is very important. It leads to the development of emotional intelligence skills and can help you in your personal and work relationships throughout your life. Keep it up!
1049,"Great reflection Taylor! Leadership is one of the biggest, most sought after qualities to have in a candidate. With leadership you can help others to be at the level of understanding you are. Keep doing what you are doing, it will strengthen this skill in the long-run! If you\'re looking for more ways to get involved, consider some of the orgs at PSU (clubs.psu.edu). Best of luck!"
1050,"I\'m not entirely sure where this title comes in to play, I would change it to better tell the short 4-word story summary of this post. I also LOVE your style of writing! Throw up the Creativity skill tag for this post. You did a really great job in really helping the reader envision the blueberry picking trip."
1051,"I would maybe even add the adaptability tag to this post. Reading this post shows me how you have adapted to the college life so much that you didn\'t have a thought in your mind about how it was, until you were reminded. You\'re style of writing was also very engaging and enjoyable to read!"
1052,"I really like your extended use of vocabulary and the imagery you paint in your writing. However, I do believe there is some parts of your post that seem unnecessary. Some of that space could\'ve been used to elaborate more on how this experience embodied the \""""Teamwork\"""" skill tag. I definitely would like to see more posts that further elaborate on your teamwork skills!"
1053,"So sorry to hear about your grandfather, my condolences. Your post was written very well and I think it is really nice you used a personal picture to help support your writing! I am eager to see more posts in the future about your skill developments. If you are really into music, if you are not already in a PSU music group, I highly suggest joining one that best fits your interests. This will help you experience scenarios that will help you develop your skills further!"
1054,"Great reflection, Casey. Sharing your experience and perspective with others is a great skill to have in the work environment. And showing your patience and willingness to explain makes you a strong team member and leader. Nice job!"
1055,"This is a really great story! It really embodies your intercultural Skills tag very well! To further develop these skills and learn even more, I highly suggest joining a group in Penn State where you can connect, and teach others about your culture. You could also learn from others as well."
1056,"Allowing people to share each other\'s ideas is critical in the work environment especially when trying to execute on a concept or new project. Startups deal with this on a daily basis. If you would like more experience with bringing ideas to life, consider joining groups like Innoblue!"
1057,"I would definitely add the intercultural skill tag for this post as well. If you want to learn Chinese and a little about the culture too, I highly suggest joining BAOCP (Buddhist Association Of Centre Pennsylvania) in State College! They are really great people and you do some pretty fun stuff with them and its not a religion-specific group!"
1058,"Thanks for sharing your experience! Dislocating your arm must not have been a fun memory. And that is very admirable of you mother to care for your grandmother. I suggest you dive deeper into how you see yourself as similar to your mother. Since this narrative is a reflective piece, you want to look back on your own experiences."
1059,"I really liked the way you described that everyone was together but separate. You did a great job with creating imagery in your post. However, I would take the specific situation you had with your group members not getting along and create a separate post about it. I feel like you can explain and elaborate on it well enough to add a conflict resolution skill tag as well!"
1060,I would definitely add intercultural skills in place of presentation skills. This seems like it was a great experience! I highly suggest participating in more experiences at PSU such as these to broaden your skills!
1061,"I would definitely add intercultural skills to your skill tags. I feel like you could further elaborate on this and really display your skills. However, you did a great job describing the experience you had with the skill swap!"
1062,"You did a great job at explaining your experience. Good job at using an original picture! It really compliments your writing well. I highly suggest further elaborating on your cross-country experience, I feel like it would make for a great post on teamwork and leadership!"
1063,"First off, I would by lying if I didn\'t say this made me laugh hysterically. I would definitely add the skill tags interpersonal skills and intercultural skills to your tags. You did a great job writing this clearly for your readers to understand."
1064,"Katie, this is a great reflection piece on a difficult decision.  My wife also was on the pre-med path and found the same thing (mainly because of organic chemistry).  She had to question her end outcome and got a minor in business. It worked out well as she landed a role as national marketing manager for a cable ad company.  Cheers to you on making the switch.  Also, I have a close friend who works in HPA in Virginia if you want to connect with someone in the field. Email: dknicely@liveitu.com"
1065,It is great that you were able to connect to your inner values through this retreat. I highly suggest the ontinuation of this discovery by participating in other groups or activities in PSU or at home. You described your skills very well in this post!
1066,"Katie, thanks for sharing your THON experience! You will use teamwork almost everyday of your life, which is why the skill is important to develop. This post really encapsulates the idea of how you understood the importance of teamwork, and used your skills to help your team. Good job!"
1067,"Great reflection, Jackie. While you developed leadership skills, I would also suggest that you tag the skill \'Risk Taking\' as you have mentioned in your entry. That\'s another great quality to have in the work environment!"
1068,"Nice reflection, Amy! As you continue through adulthood, you will experience different types of leaders. It\'s always beneficial to  understand how different styles affect the team\'s morale and productivity. Consider taking leadership roles in multiple student orgs to gain new perspectives. Check out clubs.psu.edu. Great work!"
1069,"Emily, it\'s great to see how much you learned from this leadership retreat. Definitely agree with your last point of getting to know yourself, your strengths and weaknesses. The best way to do this is to put yourself in situations where you\'re out of your comfort zone- you\'re guaranteed to learn about yourself. When something both scares and excites you, you know you\'re on the right path! I hope you\'re involved in some of this kind of activity outside the classroom."
1070,"Great reflection, Megan. I\'m happy to hear you had a great experience at your retreat. Being a good leader also means being a good teammate. And you\'ll see that throughout your college and professional career. As Shannon said, get involved with orgs on campus!"
1071,"Great reflection, Emily! I would also suggest tagging the skills \'Self-Awareness\' and \'Teamwork\' to this post. I feel that these are skills you developed to complement your leadership skills. Good work!"
1072,"Victoria- I\'d love to hear the stories behind the different experiences you had at this great internship!  I see a lot of potential for more entries, I\'m guessing here it was hard to fit everything into one here. Since you were exposed to so much variety, consider writing a few entries that go in-depth by demonstrating how you learned these valuable skills."
1073,I agree with Helena! You seem have learned several things from this internship. Feel free to break up by project or event!
1074,"Great post, Tram! I\'m glad to see you were able to learn a lot from this experience. \'Teamwork\' or \'Leadership\' are other skills you could tag on this post since the retreat aimed to help develop those skills. Nice work!"
1075,"It\'s awesome that you took the initiative to learn more about this problem, as well as develop a way to educate others. Having done a weight-restricted sport in college and having a lot of athlete friends, I know there is a need for education on this subject. 

I definitely suggest reaching out to other PSU women\'s teams, and staff who work on athletic nutrition counseling, to keep this project moving forward. Consider getting others from your team involved as well- many hands make light work!"
1076,"Sounds like an enlightening experience! The hardest part about being a leader is still applying those three \""""pillars\"""" during tough times, when your natural human reaction might be to do something different that is less effective or even damaging.  
Now that you understand the philosophy behind being a great leader, how are you putting this into action? I\'d love to see another entry on a real life leadership experience and any surprises you encountered while implementing the above."
1077,"Agreed on your last point- great leaders help those around them reach their potential, rather than focusing on \'leading.\' 
I\'ll always remember being completely paralyzed with fear at one point during a similar high ropes course in college! I\'m glad you saw how that\'s an important lesson in emotional intelligence: in life, there will always be stressful times that come out of nowhere. The faster you can recognize and address your negative emotions, the better off you\'ll be."
1078,"Amy- it\'s great to see how much you learned from this leadership retreat. Definitely agree on the importance of getting to know yourself and your strengths and weaknesses. The best way to do this is to put yourself in situations where you\'re out of your comfort zone- you\'re guaranteed to learn about yourself. When something both scares and excites you, you know you\'re on the right path! I hope you\'re involved in an activity outside the classroom where you can find this balance."
1079,"Great reflection, Cristen! Major props for getting out of your comfort zone. Having a supportive team does make the task easier to accomplish. In the professional setting, you will learn to balance being a leader and a team player. If you\'d like some more experience, I recommend you join student orgs. Check out clubs.psu.edu!"
1080,This seems like it was a very enlightening experience for you. I believe that you can use this same type of obersavtion in other scenarios to help you further refleect and work on developing skills through reflection. This was very well written and you asked yourself a lot of good questions!
1081,I am not entirely sure if this post is about how you were accepted into the program  or if this was the process leading to it. I feel like you should take an experience what happened after this process and reflect on what you learned during one scenario within the group. Reflecting on an experience that happened with this group can help further develop your skills!
1082,"This is a GREAT position to write about and self-reflect on! You should pull from what you learned about your THON reflections on doing things for others. If you reflect on that very moment, I believe it will make for a great post on what you are capable of in terms of your skills. Your writing style is very expressive and puts good imagery in the readers head!"
1083,"I really like the connects and imagery you are creating! From reading this post, your connection with your spirit painting shows your dedication and drive to plow through your struggles. I am not sure where the war belongs in the post though, but I believe your self-reflection overviews what you have gone through and how you\'ve grown from it."
1084,"This is  agreat situation for you to elaborate your devlopment of skills on. I suggest further alaborating on these skills to show recruiters how you really solve problems step by step. If you could do this by futher explaining how you changed your study habits more in depth, this will show recruiters how your mind thinks in a crisis!"
1085,"This is a really cool invention you read about. However, I am not entirely sure how this post relates at all to you or how you are self-reflecting. I think you should make this post more about how this invention helped you to decide your major, if that is case."
1086,"Great job on the test grade! I suggest that you make this post more about how your study habits changed after you realized your mistake. This will show recruiters looking for your skills, in depth, how you deal with stress under pressure, change your habits when you need to after mistakes, and change your mindset to help achieve goals."
1087,"This is great! I really think you should elaborate more on how you raised money for your trip. If you include the plan, the execution, and the result it will show recruiter your organizational skills, dedication, and drive for something you have a passion for!"
1088,"This is a great description with a beautiful description of the imagery.   I suggest elaborating on 1 main prominent struggle you had in college thus far to show recruiters your strength, will, and leadership!"
1089,What does over the same mean? I would further elaborate on the communication and responsibility skills you learned. This will show recruiters how you developed and managed your skills.
1090,I like the dedication you showed in your writing. It is refreshing to see your motivation even when you know failures can happen!
1091,"I\'m sorry to hear about your concussion, However this post shows your dedication and perserverance through your studies. This is very good to see that you did not give up, those are qualities of a leader!"
1092,"This is nice that you summurized the event so we could see how it looked from the groups perspective! However, You should definitely show how this helped you and how you had benefitted from this experience as well!"
1093,"This is a good example of the soft skills you\'ve identified, but I feel like your conclusion is weak.  Could you use the last sentence to further explain WHY your experiment ended up being well received or be more specific  about a problem you solved or a specific lesson that you learned?"
1094,This is nice to see that you have the communications skills to work with other people and discuss your future with other people! You are on the right track with the explanation of the development of your skills. Your leadership skills are also especially important.
1095,Quite an interesting title! This post shows a lot of your teamwork interpersonall skills. I believe you are understanding the point of these posts and I highly suggest creating more posts to frame your personal skills!
1096,Nicely thought through connections from your life experiences to the artwork you chose from the museum collection.  One way to improve a reflection is to give a specific example that supports how you feel about something.  Example:  What part or specific aspect of the St. Jerome painting represents your faith.  You did this well with the first two works of art and examples from your life.
1097,"Nice job writing concise, but well supported reflections on three different pieces of art within a short paragraph.  You obviously gave some depth of thought to how you and your aspirations relate to these different pieces as well as telling a bit about the artwork.  That makes interesting reading!"
1098,"Hey Liza, this is awesome! It\'s great to hear about someone like you taking the role of a leader to help those who want it most. You determination not to give up in difficult situations is admirable. This experience is a wonderful example of leadership, but I would love to hear more about how you feel it will help you in your future. Often times experiences we learn from resonate in our future decision making, tell me about what this experience meant to you, and how it will affect your future!"
1099,"Nikki - all of these are awesome skills to have that can be applied in many work settings! One of my favorite quotes is, \""""sheer effort enables those with nothing to surpass those with privilege and position.” Try to expand on these skills; give specific examples of problem solving, or acting out good work ethic, to give a better idea of how you operate. These stories make for great potential future entries, consider breaking down some of these learned skills into separate entries!"
1100,"What a great way to leave high school - on a high note! This story is great because it took so much work to get your to your ultimate goal of attending Nationals. Consider adding the teamwork tag to this as well, since you reflected upon your team skills. Contemplate all it took to get you to finals; the hard work, challenges and initiative are all aspects you integrated to ultimately reach your goal. The specifics of what challenges you faced can later be applied in other settings!"
1101,"I agree! Touching on your experience in the workplace, volleyball and school are great ways to demonstrate that you understand what’s needed to be successful and how to apply the skills too! Consider expanding on these experiences in individual LiveIt entries to give readers a better idea of what you learned from experience, and how it will stay with you moving forward. A cheesy way to stay motivated is to remember, “the difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra.\"""""
1102,"The Martian is one of my favorite movies! This is a fun way to reflect, I would suggest going more in depth on how you would problem solve, and how those skills would be valuable in the other places you mentioned! It seems what you learned about problem solving goes hand in hand with your takeaway, don\'t be afraid to elaborate. What takeaways did you have, how will these help you in the future?   Explain how Matt Damon’s antics in outer space relate to you here on earth with specific examples!"
1103,"This is a great summary of the movie. However, from this post, I am not completely sure where you used your problem-solving and criticial thinking. I suggest either editing this post or creating a new one to showcase the skills you learned during this movie experience."
1104,This was a good representation of what you can expect at a business dinner in your future. From this post I can see you understood the importance of communication and listening to other teammates for successful and effective teamwork.
1105,"I think you  should include a picture of you painting, It sounds really great and would compliment your post well! You described how you overcame your obstacles and frustrations very well, this is a great post to showcase your skills to recruiters!"
1106,This was a great program to be involved in. Groups like these in college are great to develop skills for your future and yourself in general. I highly suggest creating another post that focuses on a scenario where you can further elaborate on your leadership skills.
1107,"I like most about this post the sentence \""""We cannot be afraid of trying new things.\"""" I highly suggest making a post of a scenario you faced in an engineering course that you can also apply these risk-taking skills to. This will show recuiters more about how you are not afraid to try new things and step out of your comfort zone for the goodness of your team."
1108,You did a really good job encapsulating the experience you and your team had at Green Bowl. I highly suggest creating another post that can help you better describe your skills in more detail. This post could be about any scenario you feel fit!
1109,I would also add to this post the effect this experience had on you and your skill building. This will show recruiters what you are capable of doing within your skill set! I suggest elaborating specifically on any obstacles you may have had during this experience.
1110,would also add to this post the effect this experience had on you and your skill building. This will show recruiters what you are capable of doing within your skill set! I suggest elaborating specifically on any obstacles you may have had during this experience.
1111,This post was written very well! It is great that you were able to elaborate on your experiences and specifically tell your reader the process of your project. Adding the picture was a good touch.
1112,"This was a great experience to have that will help you in your future with skill development and future career dinners you may have, I highly suggest creating more posts like this with like experiences with the same tone."
1113,I am glad to see you and your teammates are planning another live it experience! You did a great job explaining the skills you used during this experience. I do suggest in your next posts further explaining your specific skill development during the scenarios.
1114,"I’m glad you got to know your group partners while enjoying delicious food! I wold suggest expanding on what you learned, how you executed it and why this matters to you. What takeaway did you have and how will it help you in the future? Breaking down the process of your night at Green Bowl will help to explain how these great skills resonate with you, and can later be applied in other settings."
1115,"Hey Paul! You seemed to really enjoy The Martian, which is awesome! It’s great you were able to observe so much going on in the movie, but summarizing less and reflecting upon yourself more is a better use of the skill tags. Try to expand on these skills; give specific examples of how you would use ethical judgement or creativity to problem solve, as opposed to telling me how Watney did it in the movie. Keep up the good work!"
1116,"Devin - Green Bowl is a great place to try new foods! I’d love to hear more about your experience at the restaurant. Did you feel as though you tried something new, did you learn anything surprising about your friends? Explain to me why you chose the creativity and intercultural tags here! A quote I try to remember is, “a mind that is stretched by experience can never go back to its old dimensions.”"
1117,"This is very intuitive! I’m glad you could find a piece of art that truly resonated with you. You’re right, not may people do know what they want to do for the rest of their life, and often times, become overwhelmed in thinking about it. I hope you are involved in other activities outside of school, your leadership and insight is inspiring. I would love to read more posts about you taking the role of a leader and helping others!"
1118,"You hit the nail on the head! Teamwork is an important aspect in life, not just the classroom or on the court. The cheesy saying, “teamwork makes the dreamwork,” is something I tell my own group members all the time. Recognizing these traits paves the way for you to take initiative and be the leader, I would love to see future entries of you reflecting upon taking a leadership role. Check out this TED Talk on teamwork when you get a chance! - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0_yKBitO8M"
1119,"Hey William, this is a really great and inspiring story. I would suggest adding the critical thinking and emotional intelligence tags to your post, given you worked very hard to find what major you wanted to do, and incorporated your families’ history of working in the railroad industry! Taking initiative to figure out what major you fit best, and going to college, shows great leadership skills. Remember, “the quality of a leader is reflected in the standards they set for themselves.”"
1120,"Joseph - this is a really great post! Your insight into why the activity matters outside of 2000 degrees is a great representation of communication and reflection. If you enjoy creative extracurriculars that pertain to your major, consider joining the Penn State Robotics Club! Keep up the good work and remember, “art without engineering is dreaming, and engineering without art is calculating.”"
1121,"Hey Jason! Green Bowl is a great place to step out of your comfort zone and break barriers. I’d love to hear more about your experience at the restaurant; did you learn anything surprising about your friends, how do you feel being pushed out of a comfort zone was helpful? Elaborate more on why you chose your skill tags, and how they are applicable in other places outside of Green Bowl. A quote I try to remember is, “a mind that is stretched by experience can never go back to its old dimensions.”"
1122,"Hey, your summary on the movie is great, but try to take what you learned from Mark Watney and apply it to yourself! For example, try talking about a challenge you’ve faced, and the solution you used to resolve it. You can do this by expanding on your feelings about communication issues you’ve faced in engineering, or how you taken the role of a leader in a time of adversity!"
1123,"Andrew - this is an awesome entry! Explaining how you adapted in a tough situation shows leadership skills and flexibility. My only suggestion would be to add a takeaway; yes you learned a lot from this experience, but what does that mean for situations off the mountain? I would also suggest getting involved with Penn States Skiing / Snowboarding clubs if you aren’t already - you would make a great instructor and team leader! Keep up the good work!"
1124,"Hey Alicia! Thank you for sharing your experience, i’m glad you had a good time! Here’s what I suggest; expand on how your experience at the show, how will it resonate with you in other places? Did you learn something new or unexpected? How with this experience with your team help you in the classroom? Elaborating on these points will help to give a better understanding of how you plan to apply learned skills in different scenarios - such as the workplace!"
1125,"Hey Suryan, thanks for sharing your experience! Your insight into The Martian and its’ relation to the current state of the aerospace industry is very intuitive. Here’s what I suggest; take what you learned from The Martian, and your knowledge on the aerospace industry, and apply it to yourself. Take time to reflect upon how who you are and what you know will be an attribute to the work place. Elaborate on times you\'ve used critical thinking and conflict resolution!"
1126,"Abdulla - thanks so much for sharing your experience at Green Bowl! I’d love to hear more about your experience at the restaurant; did you learn anything surprising about your friends, why will this experience be valuable in the future? Elaborate more on why this experience was notable, and how it will help you in other places outside of Green Bowl!"
1127,"Hey, I love your style of writing, thanks for sharing your experience at Green Bowl! Here’s what I suggest; you did a great job linking the experience to skills that will be useful in many other places outside Green Bowl, however, try to reflect more on yourself and less on summarizing the event. Elaborate on how trust was established and conflicts were resolved to give a more well rounded view of the activity being an exercise in skill building!"
1128,"Hey Kevin! Your writing is very strong, thanks for sharing your experience! Here’s what I suggest; focus less on summarizing the event and more reflecting upon what this event taught you. Elaborate on how risk taking and teamwork will resonate with you in the future, not just in Green Bowl. Don’t be afraid to focus on yourself, explaining what you learned from this experience, as opposed to summarizing it, will help to give insight into who you are and the expectations you hold yourself to!"
1129,"Hey Ting! Thanks for sharing your experience with watching The Martian! Here’s what I suggest; you did a great job reflecting on how this movie relates to you, however, I would love to see you expand on your goals to become a great engineer. How do you plan to do this, in what ways do you strive to make society a better place? Your takeaway from the movie was right on track, elaborating on your last few points will just help to wrap it up nicely!"
1130,I  would also add to this post the effect this experience had on you and your skill building. This will show recruiters what you are capable of doing within your skill set! I suggest elaborating specifically on any obstacles you may have had during this experience.
1131,am glad to see you and your teammates are planning another live it experience! You did a great job explaining the skills you used during this experience. I do suggest in your next posts further explaining your specific skill development during the scenarios.
1132,I suggest writing more about your experience your audience can really get the idea and see the development process or usage of your skills.  You should reflect on your experience at rotellis and what you learned.
1133,"Again, I would use this post to reflect and connect to your skills rather than a sole summary of the movie."
1134,I highly suggest elaborating more on how the movie pertained to you and your skill development. This will show recruiters the process of how you develop your skills.
1135,"That is very important that you paid close attention to detail with Larry\'s dietary restriction. This shows you possess the coveted, attention-to-detail quality and is huge for recruiters to see!"
1136,That sounds amazing! That is really a different experience to be apart of. I highly suggest creating a follow-up to this post after the competition to further elaborate your skills put to use during this incredible oppurtunity.
1137,"This was a good way to react to this movie! I highly suggest further elaborating on your skills learned during the movie. For example, explaining the if factor of being in that situation what you and your team would do is a good place to start."
1138,You could add more here because these are such cool projects! :)
1139,Let\'s try to write complete sentences with subjects and predicates.  I would gladly meet with you to support you in this endeavor!
1140,Talk a bit about what you learned about customer service and team work.   How will this help you with your career goals.
1141,Great details within your description...
1142,Maybe you could include how much money you raised.  What was your role?
1143,Explain how this will help you with your career goals.   What problems did you encounter and how did you solve them?
1144,Explain the problems which were encountered and how were they solved.
1145,Great example of some soft skills and an experience that would be good interview discussion.  Just take another look at your last sentence.  It has at least one type and doesn\'t read quite right.
1146,It would be great to make another entry/reflection on this class now that you are half-way through the course.  Would love to read about what you have learned about yourself and others!
1147,I would encourage you to write a separate reflection on your experiences (and the soft skills you\'ve developed and grown) through working with special needs students.
1148,"Just a quick comment...we would say \""""learned\"""", not learnt.  Perhaps expand on the \""""field\"""" business knowledge you have gained as well, particularly related to \""""soft skills\"""".  A separate entry on this with specific examples of experiences that helped you build these skills would expand a future employer\'s understanding of what you can do."
1149,"I think you should add a \""""teamwork\"""" and communication tag to this posting."
1150,"Nice job of connecting your personal experiences and some soft skills you\'ve developed with starting a new business.  You\'ve provided some clear, specific examples in a succinct way."
1151,"Excellent illustration of a skill you would definitely need in starting a business and showing how you have developed it over time.  Your specific example of your English class provides a great \""""starter\"""" for an interview question."
1152,Good job of pulling together three descriptions of artworks and how they relate to your life.  Do proof read your entry again and correct the typos (or spelling/grammar) errors.  I think if you read carefully you will find them.
1153,"I don\'t know if there is a tag for perseverance, but it so, I would add it to this entry."
1154,Glad to read you learned about this concept.  It\'s a great base of understanding to gain right at the beginning of your college career.  You will have many opportunities at Penn State to expand your self-awareness in this area...if you just take advantage of them!
1155,Good job of succinctly describing how these works of art connect with your personal life and ambitions.  You might want to correct the title of your posting (since Palmer is spelled incorrectly.)
1156,"For this \""""forum\"""" of a portfolio that you might eventually share with prospective employers, you might want to focus on what this assignment means to you in the future.  How can building this soft skill of ethical judgement help you (and a future employer) make good decisions that benefit all parties."
1157,I love that you took the trip with Dr. Daley and some of you classmates. I like that you were able to develop all of these skills while building relationships with your teacher and classmates. Being able to have peace conversations about controversial topics is a great trait to have when you get into the real world. The traits you have developed in this experience will take you a long way in life. I suggest you keep developing these skills throughout your time at PSU.
1158,i love that you were able to sit in the arboretum and reflect on key events in your life. It seems like the arboretum has that effect on everyone including myself. Also Self-awarness is a very important trait to have when you are dealing people from different backgrounds. It is the first step to being able to be empathetic.
1159,"Hey Sarah, thanks for posting! That is awesome you went to a college fair, I remember finding them very helpful when I was in high school. Try to elaborate more on your experience; reflecting on the day rather than summarizing helps others to understand your thought process! Check out this article on selecting college majors for more help! - https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/explore-careers/college-majors/the-college-major-what-it-is-and-how-to-choose-one"
1160,"Sarah - this is very cool, giving back to your local community is a great way to get involved. I see you used the teamwork and community engagement tags, expand on this! What did you do to personally to contribute, did you run into any problems, what was the process of raising money? Don’t be afraid to make yourself shine! Live It is all about student success, take time to reflect upon how who you are, and what you learned, will be useful in future settings, not just the fundraiser!"
1161,"What’s up Jayne, thanks for sharing you experience! I think this is a great opportunity for you to expand on what you learned here; noting your study skills were no longer adequate shows great self-awareness, a Live It tag you could add to your post! You could also add the initiative and conflict resolution tags, given you took the problem into your own hands, sought out a solution and followed through with it. Consider telling me about other places you plan to apply what you learned here!"
1162,"MacKenzie, here’s a story: I too am a waitress and have learned how to deal with the public, coworkers and management through serving. I still remember my worst shift, any and everything that could go wrong, did. Through dealing with adversity and conflicts that arose that weren’t necessarily my fault, I learned valuable skills that I could apply in other places, such as the workforce or school. Expand on what you learned from waitressing, and reflect upon how these experiences have shaped you!"
1163,"This is very cool MacKenzie! I would suggest organizing your though process a little more to give potential recruiters a clean, smooth read. I also suggest adding a few more tags; leadership and initiative both fit the story you described! Try to reflect more, you’ve done a great job at making yourself shine, clearly you earned it, but tell me if you feel this experience will stick with you in a way you that could be useful in the future."
1164,The arboretum has the breath taking effect on people. Its truly amazing and always brings back nostalgia. After reading your post I am very happy that you have an understanding of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is very important and it is a major key to success. Another skills I see that you developed was the ability to connect your past to the present. Thats a great skill to have because our past serves as point of reference for us to see the blessings we have in life.
1165,Wow I\'m amazed. I was a Kinesiology major in my undergraduate and I didnt get a Personal training certification. So congrats to you. This shows you are goal driven and very cognizant of your future. That is a good trait that you should never lose. Kinesiology is a great major and while in it you will learn what you want to do for the rest of your life.
1166,i agree that in the past there was a lot of masculinity and love of men. You are right to say that this is still relevant today. We have a long way to go for gender equality to be reached. This post definitely shows that you have a good understanding of self-awareness.
1167,"I think it is great that you had a good time at this event. Those skills you identified at the end are very important in life. As an athletic trainer you will have to have great critical thinking skills and sometimes you will have to speak in front of large crowds. Also when you talk about those \""""great, strange, and adverse times\"""" that the author talked about it is important to remember that that is how life can be. Life is very random and you have to learn to roll with the punches."
1168,Great imagery at the beginning. Great story about the plant you mother gave you. We all have things that our parents or guardians have given us that we hold dearly. It shows a lot of responsibility to be able to take care of a plant. Also your story shows that you have the ability to juggle a lot of responsibilities at once.
1169,"This was written very well. This was a great experience to elaborate on. I highly suggest further creating posts such as this, in similar tone and style with more like experiences. I feel like you would gain from joining a community club at Penn State. There are tons of clubs you could get involved in to further explore new experiences and develop new skills while helping people!"
1170,I am impressed by your writing!  Your title is engaging as well as your posts and you use transitions very well.  This experience was explained well too! I suggest creating another post showcasing a specific play you worked on and any obstacles you may have overcame.
1171,Is this part of your major or a decision maker in your career process? If it is you should lightly touch on how it was your deciding factor. This shows the dedication you have to the field of work and the continuing dedication you will have.
1172,"A sport such as boxing is very good to be involved in. You learn about patience, dedication, and other skills that will help you later in life. I suggest making another post about an experience you had boxing where you specifically overcame obstacles.  This will show the development of your skills."
1173,"Were you involved in the project management aspect of this project?  If not,  what was your role?  I highly suggest including your role in this post.  Also I highly suggest creating another post that explains one major obstacle you faced during the project execution."
1174,"I like the touch of personality you put in your post worth the comment on the mini sized human.  It gives a true voice to your writing rather than it seeming robotic.  This is a very impressive experience to be involved in.  I highly suggest continuation in experiences, groups, and projects at this level."

1192,"This seems like you learned a lot about this workshop. Your style of writing really helps the reader to envision the experiments that were performed.

Your idea to put out coffee cake is quick thinking, sharing more stories where you had good ideas wold be interesting to read about - keep up the good work!"
1207,"Hey Shannon! This is a great post, I also recommend expanding on some key points in other Live It entries.

You seemed to learn a lot form these experiences, so they would make great material for future Live It entries!"
1208,"Hey Shane, thanks for your entry! I\'m glad you had a nice experience, but consider telling me a little more about it. Elaborate on what you learned, how it was a team bonding experience and why it would matter to a potential recruiter. Ask yourself questions such as; did any issues arise, how did you contribute, do you consider yourself the team leader? Reflecting more on your experience as opposed to summarizing will help to paint a better picture of who you are!"

1213,"This is good, but consider summarizing less and reflecting more! Instead of just telling me what happened, explain to me why you feel this experience was important in the aspect of skill building. What about this experience was significant, and why would it be interesting to a recruiter? Keep up the good work!"
1214,"Hey Nicole, thanks for sharing! I agree with Shannon, your summary of the movie is really strong, but tell me how it pertains to you! Instead of just summarizing, reflect.

1216,"What\'s up Ian! This is a great post, you portrayed your struggles with the assignment well. The only thing I would suggest is elaborating on your takeaway a bit more. The need to be versatile is a good conclusion, but I would love to hear more about why you chose your major, and how you ultimately figured out a way to paint it on pottery. Keep up the good work!"
1217,This sounds like it was a good experience. You should further elaborate on this post to show the development and usage of your skills!

Ask yourself; what did this experience teach you, was it helpful, will you be able to use the skills you learned here outside of the Green Bowl setting? Overall this is a great start, keep up it up!"
1230,"I love this movie! Very cool way to apply skill building. I would suggest expanding here too; consider telling me about a time you faced adversity just as Mark did! Perhaps it was at work, in the classroom or in an organization. Your recognition of his great problem solving ability is great, tell me how it applies to you!"
1231,"What\'s up Jian, this is a great summary of the movie, it seems you really grasped what was going on. Here\'s what I suggest; take all you observed in this movie and apply it to you! Were you ever faced with adversity in any type of setting, how did you handle it? Were you innovative like the NASA team, or were you creative like Mark? Consider writing a new entry where you can discuss these skills, I would love to read it!"
1232,"So glad to hear you say reflecting became a habit!  It is so very important to think about and reflect on what you are learning and your experiences, so that you can first, soak them in, and second, figure out how to improve in the future.  There is always room for growth and often you need to figure out how to make that happen for yourself!"
1233,"this was a good experience you had. However, I highly suggest further explaining the skills you learned during this scenario. It will better help recruiters understand the way you develop and use skills."
1234,This was a nice description of why you chose the flavors you did. I highly suggest following up on one of those memories brought by your flavors and creating another post to embody the skills you developed during that scenario.
1235,"This was a good summary of the movie. However, I highly suggest either revping this post or creating a new one to credit your skills to. You should tell of a scenario the movie reminded you of or invoked between your team that helped you to develop these skills."
1236,I would further discuss any scenario or obstacle that may have happened during this event. Use that obstacle to your advantage by telling your audience and recuiters through the posts how you developed skills (or used them) during this time.
1237,This was a good observation about not being botanist since it is a different approach that would be taken in the movie as opposed to real life with engineers. I highly suggest further expanding this post by creating another and further elaborating on the plan your team came up with in order to survive this situation.
1238,I highly suggest futher building on this post by elaborating more thoroughly the development and usage of your skills.
1239,"Rather than saying which skills and why they would be useful during a situation like this, you should relate the situation to a scenario you have faced before or will with your team in which you can use the skills from the tags you put with this post."
1240,"I would further expand on this post and elaborate on the development and usage of your skill tags rather than just a short explanation of each one. These posts, if used effectively, should be able to help you better explain you and your skills to future employers and recruiters."
1241,"What\'s up Luke, you hit the nail on the head here. Your understanding of the movie is very strong, but i\'m most impressed with your ability to relate it to you and your team. Kudos to you!

1243,"Hey Jordan, thanks for sharing! Your entry here is great, you not only summarized, but reflected upon your experience too. I would love to hear more about your team and how you work together, consider writing new Live It entries to go into more detail!

1244,"Hey Mitchell, i\'m not sure you completely understand the point of this Live It challenge.

How will this be applicable in the workplace? I hope to see new posts from you soon!"
1245,"Hey Mengxiong, thanks for sharing your experience! This is a great summary, I could really picture what you were describing. My only suggestion would be to summarize just a little less, and focus more on a takeaway. I would love to see you tell me a little more of what you were thinking during this experience, and how what you learned will stick with you! Keep up the good work!"
1246,"This is good! You seem to have grasped the deeper meaning of this exercise very well. I hope to read more entires by you soon, maybe you could write about an experience from your home in China, or an experience you\'ve had since coming to college. Either way, i\'m looking forward to it!"
1247,"Hey William, this is a great first post! Your reflection on why this exercise will be useful in the classroom is exactly what Live It looks for. My only suggestion would be to expand on your takeaway a little more, really unpack what you learned from this experience, and how it will stick with you!"
1248,"What\'s up Paul, thanks for sharing! Your summary on the experience was great, but consider adding a stronger takeaway. Ask yourself; what did you learn from this? Will it be useful in other settings? Do you feel your team will work better having done this together? Keep up the good work!"
1249,"Paul - your summary of the movie is good, but tell me how it pertains to you. Use Mark Watney\'s problem solving and critical thinking, and relate it to yourself. Have you ever faced a complicated problem where you thought creatively? Do you feel you will ever have to, being a mechanical engineering major? Connect the dots between you and Mark to paint a better picture of your thought process!"
1250,"Hey Wonsuk, thanks for sharing! Your summary of the movie is strong, but try to connect the events of the movie to yourself. Consider reflecting upon your major, if you yourself have ever faced adversity, and if so, how you handled it. Adding a stronger takeaway in which you focus on yourself first by relating the movie to you will help recruiters to get a better idea of who you are!"
1251,"This was a great summary of your experience, however i highly suggest further elaborating on your actual use of your creativity skill tag or development of the skill."

I highly suggest reflecting on this experience in a way that the recruiters can see the use and development of your skills and how they can you use you in their company.
1255,"The picture included was a really nice touch to bring your post to life! It takes a lot of skill, bravery, risk-taking, and confidence to get out in front of a large audience of strangers. This is a GREAT trait to have. I would definitely add the risk-taking skill to your post tags!"
1256,"Hey Khaled, your post is great! I like how you summarized the movie to give a little background, however, I suggest relating this experience a little more to yourself.

1257,"What\'s up Jeffrey! Thanks for sharing your experience, this is a great entry. Your takeaway here is really strong, but I wold love to hear a little more background as to what you did at Green Bowl. Consider this when creating future Live It entries!"
1258,"What\'s up Ryan, thanks for posting! Your summary here is great, however, I suggest reflecting more in order to enhance your entry. Consider taking what happened in the movie and relating it to yourself. Ask yourself how this movie set in space, relates to you as a mechanical engineering major on Earth! Keep up the good work, I would love to read more entries by you!"
1259,"Hey Matthew, thanks for sharing your experience! Consider expanding on this; unpack what you did there and why it was important.

1261,"This is a good entry, but I would love to know more about the steps leading up to your takeaway. Consider unpacking the process of the dinner in order to give a better idea of who you are, and how you operate! Remember, \""""reflective thinking turns experience into insight.\"""""
1262,"Just one quick correction to make...\""""wedding party\'s\"""" is possessive.  You need to use the plural, which would be \""""wedding parties.\""""  Good illustration of thinking on your feet and keeping good customer service in mind!"

Think of a takeaway that relates to the soft skills Live It encourages!"
1264,"This is a good entry, your writing style is fun! Consider relating the movie more to yourself. Have you ever faced a complicated problem? Did you resolve it yourself,  or with the help of others? These questions will help you to reflect on the experience more, as opposed to summarizing."

1266,"The entry is good, but consider unpacking it a little more. Give more background on the experience in order to explain how you came to conclude it would help to enable teamwork! Remember, \""""reflective thinking turns experience into insight.\"""""
1267,The stir-fry dinner is something that mimicks the types of dinners you will have in your future careers. It is important you voice your development of your skills during this event to show recruiters how these dinners work for you.
1268,Team buildoing activities such as these are very important. it is imperative that you understand an effective way to work with your teammates and build stronger connection for a better work environment. It is great to get involved in these sort of activities.
1269,"What\'s up Zixuan, thanks for sharing! Your summary here is great, my only suggestion would be to expand on your takeaway.

1270,"This entry is good too, but unpack it a little more. Give more background and a takeaway in order to paint a fuller picture! Will this lunch be beneficial to you in a setting outside of Green Bowl such as the classroom or workplace? Don\'t stop now, keep up the good work!"

1274,"I really like that you compared and contrasted your Live It experiences, that\'s something I haven\'t seen before. My only suggestion here would be adding a takeaway; consider adding a sentence or two that summarizes your ultimate thoughts, in order to tie the paragraph up nicely."
1275,"I wanted to let you know, you do not need to highlight the skill tags within the post. You can solely explain the development or use through the personal story of your situation. This will help recruiters to better understand the way you work in your skill usage. However, I highly do suggest speaking on your personal use of these skills rather than the movie\'s use."
1276,"I wouldn\'t particularly say this is presentation skills. aI would put this under risk-taking and initiative. I say this because you made a decision to try something new that you wouldn\'t normally do and took a risk doing something you have never done before. This shows the initiative you took to go out of your way to do something you are not entirely keen on, but you still do it because it is something new."
1277,"This was a great summary of the movie. However, you should focus on how these skills applied to you rather than how the movie utilized them. It is good the movie at least sparked conversation with your teammates so you could futher strengthen the team bond."
1278,"Hey Drew! Thanks for sharing your experience, your summary of the movie is great, but I highly suggest reflecting more. In reflecting, consider relating the movie more to yourself and your major as a mechanical engineer. Ask yourself if the challenges / skills Watney implemented in space such as teamwork, critical thinking and initiative, are challenges / skills you would use in the classroom or workplace."
1279,"Drew - this is a good entry. You gave background on the experience, as well as reflected on what it meant to you! My only suggestion would be to unpack it a little more; tell me more of what you did at Green Bowl, and how it is a good team building experience."
1280,"What\'s up Vincent! Thanks for sharing your experience, I strongly suggest reflecting more and adding a takeaway to your entry. In reflecting, consider relating the movie to yourself and your major as a mechanical engineer. Ask yourself if the challenges / skills Watney implemented in space, such as teamwork, critical thinking and initiative, are challenges / skills you would use in the classroom or workplace. Then, add a takeaway to conclude what this experience meant to you!"
1281,"The reflection here is better! For this post, I suggest unpacking the experience more. Tell me what you did at Green Bowl that lead to your feelings of a positive team bonding experience. In doing so, you\'ll give potential recruiters better insight into how you think and work!"
1282,"Paul - this is a good entry, your summary is great and you had a takeaway that wrapped things up nicely! My only suggestion would be to cut down on details, and add more reflection.

1283,"Hey Jason, this is a great entry! Not only did you summarize you experience, but you reflected upon it, and gave a great takeaway, nice!

1285,"Hey Kyle, this is a good entry! My only suggestion would be to \'flip\' around the paragraph. Instead of writing your conclusion about the experience first, consider writing it last as a takeaway. Summarize the event, reflect upon what you learned, then give a takeaway to tie up the paragraph. Your writing is great, this just may be helpful in writing future entries!"
1286,"William - this is a good entry! You gave a fun background of the assignment, as well as had a strong takeaway that concludes your paragraph nicely. However, I would suggest adding more reflection in between the two. For example, consider giving insight as to why or what specifically made you feel this experience will be helpful when working with your teammates in the future! Keep up the good work!"
1287,"Hey Zachary! Your writing is very strong, I could picture the perfect day in vivid color! That being said, consider taking more time to reflect, as opposed to summarizing. Take your perfect day and apply it to the working world. Ask yourself; what about these skills would be seen as interesting or valuable to potential recruiters? Projecting your reflections onto the Live It platform allows for insight into how you think and work!"

Keep up the good work, I\'ll keep an eye out for your next post!"
1289,"Hey Agustey! This is a cool idea, it seems everyone learned a lot. Your background here is great, but consider focusing on yourself more in future posts. For example, i\'m glad you learned a lot about snapchat, but i\'m much more interested in what you taught others, given it pertains to your specific culture! Also, kudos to you for your takeaway, it shows you know not only how to summarize, but also reflect. Keep it up!"
1290,"Olga, i\'m a huge fan of your writing style, it\'s almost poetic. Your group struggle is a great way to reflect on your skills, however, consider focusing more on yourself and less on background information. In this situation, you have the opportunity to talk about how you personally handled it, and why, giving insight into how you operate. Keep this in mind when creating future posts, keep up the good work!"
1291,"This was a great summary of the movie. Howevr, I highly suggest specifically showing how this movie helped you develop the skills rather than how Mark developed skills."
1292,I highly suggest in the future tying back the movie contents to your personal skills learned and used based on the events in the movie.
1293,"I love your title, it\'s very creative. This is fun, your writing is strong and descriptive, I could almost feel the warm weather. I would love to read more entries by you where you expand on different experiences at Penn State, given our environment usually shapes who we grow to be! Keep up the good work."
1294,"Hey Sumit! Way to not only summarize your experience in a fun way, but reflect upon it too. Kudos! You\'ve got the Live It mindset of thinking down, I would love to read future entries by you. Consider creating future entries pertaining to chemical engineering, life at PSU or a club you\'re in / interested in. Keep up the good work!"
1295,"Hey Natalie, thanks for sharing your experience! This is a strong entry, your reflection on the day is great. While this is a good entry, don\'t be afraid to make yourself shine!  Consider focusing more on yourself, and less on summarizing, in future posts. SHO TIME sounds very interesting, it would make for great Live It entry material. Expanding upon what SHO TIME is and why it\'s important to you would help potential recruiters to gain better insight - keep that in mind for next time!"
1296,"Jack - while your descriptive writing is overwhelmingly vivid, consider spending less time summarizing and more expanding on Leadership JumpStart. Ask yourself; what did you learn, how will it apply in other places, do you consider yourself a leader? Unpack what you learned from them / your own team. If you\'re having trouble linking blueberry island and Leadership JumpStart, consider separating them into two different posts! Keep up the good work!"
1297,"Hey Raza, I love this idea! Consider expanding on your mission statement in separate Live It entries. For example, contemplate times you\'ve helped others; are you part of a club that focuses on giving back, have you taught others and learned unexpectedly from doing so? Unpacking your thought process allows for others to see into your line of thinking, and in general, get to know the type of person you are!"
1298,"This is great post. Huge improvement from the first post. I love when you say \""""college is an experience that continuously builds on itself, like this art piece.\"""" This quote shows how aware you have become and you ability to apply this experience to your life. This post allows me to find out exactly who you are as a student and as a person. These are the posts that we want on Live IT. This displays all the soft skills that employers like. "
1299,The Arboretum has this magical way of making us think of our past and how it molded us. I think the best part of your post is when you speak on all the difficulties you have been through in life and how they have allowed you to grow. I urge you to continue to reflect on your experiences as a child and as a PSU student because with reflection comes the realization of skills.
1300,This is a good post. I like how you speak on the fact that most people go through struggle in life and that in those tough times you learned some of life greatest lessons. You showed a lot of skills within this post and I know you will continue to develop these skills as you continue your journey at PSU.
1301,"Great that you went to the museum with a classmate. Connecting you past work experience to this art work is exactly what Dr. Daley is looking for in these post. This allows you to connect a past job to skills that you can offer a future employer. Also your last observation of the \""""cradling wheat\"""" displays that you are an ambitious person, which will serve you well at PSU. "
1302,"I love that you had an open mind and did something out of your comfort zone. That is what college is all about, Discovery. Music has a great way of making us nostalgic and calming us down. I task you with being open to different types of experience, like music, in order to discover new things about yourself because like i said before college is about discovery"
1303,I love that you are going outside of your comfort zone because this is something you will have to do throughout your college career. I like how you connected this experience to your future occupation. This shows you ability to be aware of your surroundings and how everything you do in college can be related to your future success.
1304,"Hey Brian, thanks for sharing! I love your writing style, it\'s fun and captivating You did a great job not only summarizing your experience, but reflecting upon it too, kudos! I would love to read more live it entries by you in the future, maybe something pertaining to THON or volleyball. Keep up the good work!"
1305,"What’s up Joel, this is very cool! I liked that you gave background on your experience for those who may not be up to speed on what a robot competition consists of. You also did great when it comes to not only summarizing, but reflecting as well. Keep up the good work!"
1306,"Nice, I hope you did well in the competition! Consider strengthening this post by adding a takeaway, or in other words, a sentence to wrap up both your experience and your reflection!"
1307,"Joel, I really love how your brain thinks in ways mine couldn\'t possibly fathom. Consider diversifying your Live It portfolio by writing about different topics. Perhaps your ability to speak multiple languages, your life in the UK or your time spent playing frisbee! Soft skills come in many shapes and forms, I would love to hear about yours!  "
1308,"What’s up Eclair, thanks for sharing your experience! While your post is great, you can strengthen it by not just summarizing, but reflecting as well! By reflecting, you’re giving potential recruiters insight into not just your skills, but who you are as a person. Unpack and personalize your entry by explaining the experience, then telling me how you feel your lifestyle fits. Hope to read more entries by you soon!"
1309,"Hey Nina, I love the way you painted the picture of you painting pottery! Your writing is great and it seems your people skills are just as good. Interpersonal abilities are often extremely important when it comes to healthcare, so kudos to you for shining in that aspect. I would love to read more entries by you soon, keep up the good work!"
1310,"Awesomeness in this post! What’s up Manuel, thanks for sharing! I’m glad you had a good time at your dinner, your post portrayed that very well. Consider writing more entries based around your daily experiences. Maybe something based around your ability to speak multiple languages, or your love for a certain sport. Hope to read more posts soon! "
1311,"Thanks for sharing your experience Jordan! You did a great job summarizing, but I would love to see you reflect a little more upon your experience. Unpack it; don’t just write about what happened, but dig deeper to connect this experience with who you are and how you work! Recruiters are interested in gaining a well rounded view of you, reflecting upon yourself and experience will aid in doing that! Keep up the good work!"
1312,"Hey Marco, this is a great story that reflects the skills you’ve developed! Like Ricky said, I too suggest diving more into the events of what happened, in order to give a better representation of who you are! Explain what the events of the day you put together were and shift the focus from your childhood complication, to your adulthood skill development. Keep up the good work!"
1313,"It takes a lot to not only recognize your weakness, but take action to better yourself, kudos to you for being able to do that! I like you ability to be humble, it’s a very humanizing attribute that will appeal to many coworker and recruiters, making you a valuable asset. I would love to read more of your entries in the future, hope to see them soon!"
1314,"Hey Grace, this is a great observation. I love that you were able to look at a piece of art and apply not just meaning to it, but meaning that resonates with you personally! I suggest adding the curiosity and critical thinking skill tags to this post, given you reflected upon this piece to find deeper meaning. Keep up the good work!"
1315,"While I love your line of thinking, I do suggest adding a takeaway to strengthen your entry. Consider adding a takeaway to help wrap up your entry neatly, as well as give the reader better insight into what you learned and concluded from your experience. "
1316,"You are so right in that there is always room for improvement, no one is perfect! I would love to read more about you experiences and less about specific skill tags! For example, consider creating new entries where you tell more about a specific volunteer experience, or a time you felt your teamwork skills were tested! "
1317,"While this is true, i’m not sure you’ve expressed how this pertains to you. Instead of just stating something you believe, consider giving an example of a time you practiced this, then reflect upon it to give further insight!"
1318,"Cool, I loved volunteering in high school too! This demonstrates valuable aspects about you both professionally, and personally, kudos! Consider getting involved with volunteer initiatives at Penn State, if you haven’t already, to further your skill development! Check out: http://volunteer.psu.edu/organizations"
1319,"“Enjoy the little things in life, one day you’ll look back and realize they were the big things,” is a cheesy quote I like to keep in mind! This is a nice outlook to have on life, I suggest adding the adaptability and intercultural skills tags to this post!"
1320,"These are all really good observations, I would just love to see a takeaway to tie together this entry! You make many good points, so it is easy to get lost in the details. Adding a takeaway will reiterate what is most important! "
1321,"This gives good insight as to how you operate, but consider giving less background and more reflection in future posts. By this I mean expand on how you operate, what you would like to change, and why. In doing so you will reflect upon your habits, give insight to readers, and grow your soft skills! "
1322,"This is a great post that gives insight as to who you are! Here’s what I suggest; add a takeaway to strengthen your entry. Adding a takeaway will not only wrap your paragraph up neatly, but allow potential recruiters to understand what you got out of this experience, and why it’s valuable!"
1323,"I suggest giving less background and more reflection to better the quality of your post! Instead of explaining the lead up to your performance of the experiment, focus more on the process of working in a team, and the execution of the experiment itself. In doing so, you are reflecting upon what actually led to the development of your soft skills, and giving insight to readers!"
1324,"This is a very cool experience that demonstrates your skills are valuable both professionally, and personally! If you haven’t already, consider getting involved with volunteer initiatives at Penn State! Check out: http://volunteer.psu.edu/organizations"
1325,"Hey Emma! I love your writing style, it’s very descriptive! This is a great entry, you not only gave background on your experience, but reflected upon it, thereby giving insight as to who you are as a person. Kudos! Keep up the good work, I would love to read more entries by you. "
1326,"Hey Weichen, thanks for sharing! Here’s what I suggest; focus less on summarizing the event, and more reflecting upon it. Instead of telling me details on the art pieces and your tour, consider unpacking the experience and what it meant to you. Was there an art piece you felt related to you, if so, why? How does this experience help you to expand and develop your soft skills? Reflection will help give meaning to your experiences, as opposed to just memories."
1327,"While these are good attributes to have in the workplace, I would love for you to convey how this experience applies to you through example. Instead of telling me what you value, demonstrate it through experience via a story! Also, be wary of the word limit in future posts! "
1328,"This post is great in that it gives insight as to who you are, and the life you lead. However, I do suggest only including one art piece per post. It seems each piece resonated with you in a different way, creating individual posts per piece will allow for you to elaborate on your thoughts and connections with the art in a more personal way through reflection! "
1329,"Hey Maeve, it seems your entry got cut off! Consider rewriting it in order to conclude your entry! While you’re at it, consider taking out a few background details, and emphasizing more on the experience itself through reflection. By this I mean as yourself questions such as; what did this teach me, how will I use it in the future, why is it valuable, etc. This will help recruiters to get a better idea of who you are and how you operate!"
1330,"Whoops, your entry got cut off again! Consider removing background details and focusing more on yourself. Recruiters want to hear about you, not the other girls on your team. Don’t be afraid to make yourself shine! Summarize your experience, then reflect upon it to elaborate on how your soft skills developed. "
1331,"All of your reflections as to why these paintings resonate with you personally are great, but I would love more details. Consider breaking this post up into individual posts per art piece in order to elaborate more on how these paintings connect with you, your soft skills and why!"
1332,"Nailed it! You not only did a great job of summarizing your experience, but reflecting upon it as well. In conveying your growth of soft skills through a story, you’ve allowed for potential recruiters to have insight into who you are as a person. Keep up the good work!"
1333,"Taylor, wonderful to read you are taking advantage of the PSU alumni network! As you move forward on your journey, I encourage you to continue to seek opportunities to network with others and craft experiences aligned with the skill sets required to be successful in the field. The PSU Student organizations offer several opportunities to do so. "
1334,"I encourage you to continue to find time to reflect on experiences. It is a practice, many great leaders embrace as it allows for both personal and professional growth. Ralph Waldo Emerson stated \""""Most of the shadows of life are caused by standing in our own sunshine.\"""" So, find time, in your busy life, to step out of the shadows and reflect on a situation as often doing so lets the sunshine in!"
1335,"I aways love to hear stories where older students serve as role models! I also think it is important we share the impact those individuals have had in our lives, at some point. So the question becomes, what opportunities will you pursue to demonstrate leadership on campus? There are many student organizations available at https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/hub/studentorgs/orgdirectory/search.aspx Perhaps you can craft similar experiences here on campus?"
1336,"So glad you were able to join us for the event! While I recognize the event may or may not be an event you would find yourself attending under normal circumstances, it is important for us to continue to step our of our comfort zone and expose ourselves to different perspectives. Doing so, allows us to grow both personally and professionally. So, as you continue on your journey, I encourage you to continue to seek and explore the many opportunities available to you at PSU. Well done!"

1338,The arboretum is good for making someone nostalgic. These moments allow you see how far you have come and where you want to go. I suggest you continue going to the arboretum if its one of the only things that sparks this reflection because it is important for your development.
1339,I love the imagery in this post. It also shows that you are reflective and have a history of being responsible. This will take you a long way at psu while you are transitioning from an immature high school student to an adult.
1340,"Hey Alexander, thanks for sharing your story! Pledge Class Social Chair is huge responsibility, congratulations! I like that you related specific skills to your position, however, I do suggest elaborating on them more in a narrative fashion. Instead of just saying you got ‘x’ position and learn ‘x’ skills, consider telling a specific story of a time you had to use a certain skill! "
1341,"Very cool, This is an awesome experience! Again, I would suggest getting a bit more specific. Was there a time you faced adversity on the job or took up the leader position? Maybe there was a time you felt to be extra fulfilling; why, what did you do? Reflect upon how you put your new learned skills into action! "
1342,"Try to elaborate more on your statement, “the skills I acquired were more experienced oriented,” as well as the different outcomes you felt occurred! In doing so, you’re giving better insight into your thought process for potential recruiters. Try not to just summarize your experience, but reflect, in order to truly convey your skills!"
1343,"Hey Jason, this is very cool. Here’s what I suggest; elaborate more on the process of designing the pedal tray. It seems you faced adversity when designing the break petal, unpack the process of designing it, then overcoming your obstacles! Try not to just summarize an experience, but reflect upon it as well to get better insight into who you are, and how your work! "
1344,"Wow, that’s pretty impressive. Again, I suggest here you elaborate on the process of repairing the car, it must have been quite the ordeal! Don’t just say what you did, explain it! Then, reflect upon why this experience, and what you learned, would matter in the workplace."
1345,"Very nice! Consider splitting this post up into two different entries; one where you share a story about an experience being an Academic Affairs Chairman, and another where you share a story about your experience the Student Leadership conference in Orlando!"
1346,"While this is a great story, I’d like to know more! Dig deeper into this experience; do you feel it shaped you in your college major choice, will it play a part in the type of job you want in the future? Consider giving specific examples of why you chose the problem solving and critical thinking skill tags!"
1347,Being in a fraternity gives you access to many different extracurricular activities such as charity work. I suggest you take advantage of this because it will allow you to develop your skills and it shows employers you are more than just a student.
1348,"Hey Tomomi, thanks for sharing! This is very cool, it must have took a lot of dedication to get your chorus to the city finals. I suggest you take this post and either break it up, or focus on one specific story. For example, a specific story of a time you provided moral support, acted as a mediator or assisted members beyond designated practice would be great to convey how you truly operate in times of adversity! Keep up the good work!"
1349,"I love how involved you are! I think this post can be improved by focusing less on the minor details, and reflecting more upon becoming president during what you described to be a difficult time. In doing so, you’re no only telling recruiters how you stepped up, but reflecting upon what you learned from that experience, and how it has shaped you!"
1350,"Hey Liam, thanks for sharing. While it’s cool you had this experience, I’m not exactly sure how it translates into your soft skill development. Consider summarizing less on the company, and reflecting more upon what would be a better fit for you with a specific story. For example, perhaps there was a class that had loose deadlines in which you didn’t do as well, and for this reason, you know you prefer a strict schedule!"
1351,"This is an awesome entry, great job! You not only summarized the event, but reflected upon what it means to you and had a good takeaway, kudos!"
1352,"This entry is good too! My only suggestion would be to summarize a little less, and focus more on yourself. I like that your take away concludes this was a reassuring experience, but I would love to read a little more about why it was appealing to you, and in general, the types of jobs you\'re interested in!"
1353,"Katelyn, this sounds like an interesting talk! I love learning what different jobs entail, and which skills they need that aren\'t stated on the job description. I encourage you to do as many informational interviews as you can- it\'ll help you learn what\'s out there and what sounds like something you might want to pursue. Check out these links:  https://www.livecareer.com/quintessential/informational-interview-questions https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-tips-for-nonawkward-informational-interviews"
1354,"Company culture is extremely important in terms of both an individual\'s success, happiness, and engagement; and the company\'s bottom line. I\'m glad the discussion centered around this! It\'s great that you\'re self-aware enough to understand that Qualtrics might not be the best fit for you even though the culture has it\'s pluses.   It\'s always a smart idea to learn everything you can about a company\'s culture before moving forward with them. I\'d suggest asking about it during interviews and looking at the reviews on Glassdoor.com. "
1355,"Alexander- excellent job articulating the valuable skills you\'re learning as social chair. Although I was my team\'s social chair in college, I was not expecting to hear all the connections you\'ve made between this position and your future professional life. The kinds of interpersonal skills you describe will serve you well in any situation. Getting things done at work definitely is much easier when you know how to \""""play well with others.\"""" I encourage you to keep your skill development in mind and reflect on your actions (what went well, what could have gone better) so that you can go from good to great! "
1356,"as your mentor I can say, post college is when I started really getting in tune to nutritional health and using vitamins. I also use calorie counting apps as a way to monitor nutrients intakes because it makes it a game to see how perfect I can plan my meals! "

1366,"I\'m sorry to hear you got in an accident! However, this is very impressive and helpful you were able to repair your own car.

I have never experienced traditional Chinese medicine, but it sounds very intriguing. I would say this post would not only showcase your skills but enlighten your audience on Chinese medicine and to further research it."

If you helped in the creation of this event, I highly suggest creating another post describing how you helped. If not, will benefit from this by making another post based on how it has changed your perception and helped you develop or use skills in conjunction with this event."

While this post is a good summary of all you did, consider giving less background and focusing more on the issues you highlighted.

1399,"“Teamwork makes the dreamwork,” is a cheesy saying I like to remember when doing what can be difficult group projects.

1417,I love that you found your passion of baking. A picture of what you decorated would add a personal touch.
1418,THON is a great organization and I am glad you were able to share the experience with others. The longest I danced in the stands was 21 consecutive hours.
1419,"You have an insightful outlook. To ensure your health, you need to make time for yourself. Below is an article I found helpful when I was building myself.http://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/how-to-find-time-for-yourself.html"
1420,"Great work volunteering Alyssa, finding the grand compromise of efficiency and quality will serve you well in every future experience. Great work!"
1421,"Thank you Hannah. You are a beautiful young lady, with so many gifts and talents. I treasure you and our time together. I am Blessed to have you in my life. "
1422,"Hi Aziz, your entry would benefit more from elaborating more on specific details. For example, which organization did you interact with? Which was your favorite interaction and why? What in particular did you learn from them? Delve deeper and reflect on how \""""real life\"""" experiences differ from \""""college life\"""" experiences and reflect and talk about how you came to that realization."
1423,"Aziz, I see that you have used the \""""Risk Taking\"""" skill tab. I\'d love to hear more about what risks you took and how that helped you in your project. Your entry can also benefit from elaborating on your interactions with your classmates. For example, I\'m sure working with people with diverse experiences and backgrounds from you might have helped you learn something new. "
1424,"Brenna, this is a great story! I loved learning about your passion and dedication for softball and basketball. I\'d like to read more about your thought process and what factors influenced you and what inner conflicts you had to overcome to arrive to your final decision."
1425,"Brenna, great story! I loved reading about your experience as a TA at iTech Academy. It sounds like you learned so much from working along side with kids as well as being a leader and guiding/managing them. I\'m sure you learned a lot about conflict-resolution in your experience as a TA and I\'d love to hear about it more in another post when you get a chance. I think that this experience could also benefit from the \""""curiosity\"""" skill tag."
1426,"Brian, this is a very well written post! I enjoyed reading about your experience as a soccer referee. It sounds like you learned a lot about handling situations, mitigating conflict, and using your ethical judgment, thus adding the conflict resolution and ethical judgement skill tags would make sense for this post. I\'d love to hear more about how you inspired your team to reach their potential and to aim by creating specific goals. "
1427,"Brian, it sounds like you learned about the value of money and efficiency at an age where not many young people do. It sounds like you took a lot of initiative. What influenced you to start your business in buying and reselling soccer jerseys?"
1428,"Ishaank, I enjoyed reading about how you blossomed into a confident public speaker after taking this class. It must have been difficult for you to overcome your fear. As an introvert, I faced the same problem at the beginning of my CAS 100 class, but as I prepared more and got familiar with the material, I learned to overcome my fear.  I\'d love to hear more about the steps you took to overcome public speaking. Do you have a favorite method of communication?"
1429,"Ishaank, I really enjoyed reading about your experience coding for the first time and to create a light weight Wikipedia search engine. I liked how you reflected and connected your curiosity with your past experience about following directions. Your ability to switch gears is very impressive and I\'m glad you were able to make that connection. What was the language you learned and what influenced you to study that particular language? "
1430,"Jae, it was a pleasure reading your entry about your experience as an international student. What a wonderful advantage it must be to have worked, learned, and befriend so many diverse people. I\'d love to hear about the similarities or difference of your experience as an international student at Penn State. For example, in what ways is it similar or the same? "
1431,"Matthew, I enjoyed reading about your THON experience. The last line really resonated with my academic experience and my journey to finding the right career path. I\'d love to hear more about what in particular you are passionate about in your job as a member for the OPPerations Committee and what gets you excited about THON."
1432,"Hi Matthew, thanks for sharing your experience. I think it\'s wonderful that you were exposed to such a great experience at a young age for 7 years. It really shows your commitment and passion for Karate and leadership. I\'d like to hear more about how your experience at the Leadership Team guided you through life, in particular, your time in college and life after graduation."
1433,"Matthew, I liked how you really brought this story to life. It sounds like a very interesting and engaging experiment and I think it was very smart and intuitive of your team to plan out your project first to save your team time and effort. Was it difficult working with your team? And how was it like to work together and bring your ideas together? "
1434,"Jake, what a wonderful story! It sounds like you learned a lot at such a young age and you probably didn\'t even know it then! I think it\'s very valuable that at just 13 years old, you expanded upon different opportunities for to expand, explore, and succeed. As you continue to reflect on your experience as a rockstar, think about how you can carry on your grit, creativity, curiosity, and passion for music throughout your time in college. "
1435,"Jake, it was exciting to read about your experience in your fraternity. It\'s wonderful how you reflected and acknowledged your responsibilities of being a leader and what managing 16 brothers would entail. Do you see yourself pursuing a career in management? "
1436,"Morgan, I understand how difficult and frustrating it must have been to work with a teammate who didn\'t seem to be interested with working with you. This will often happen a lot in a professional setting and it can be tough to handle especially if you don\'t have a middle man. How did you know who to turn to as your \""""middle man\""""? And did you ever talk to him about the reason why he wouldn\'t communicate with you?"
1437,"I think this is a great post Jackie!  I can\'t tell you the types of things I have seen some people post on social media that has caused them to speak to management at my job.  Be very careful on what you post and ensure that it is positive, upbeat, and not offensive.  And definitely keep your posts private, rather than public.  I am so happy you had a session on this because social media etiquette is so important in this day and age.  I also think it looks bad when I see staff pulling up social media on the computer.  In my line of work I think it looks like, \""""don\'t you have something else better to do?\""""  I also don\'t think it looks good if patients and families see hospital staff checking out Facebook or other social media sites so openly.  It just looks unprofessional.  If you feel compelled to check out social media, due so discretely on your phone when you take a break."
1438,"Hi Morgan, thanks for sharing your story about your experience at Cru. I think it\'s difficult to overcome the conflicts that we have within ourselves and to express/share them with people who might not understand where you\'re coming from. As you continue to face these challenges within yourself, I do urge you to find the right people to turn to. Everyone has been there and you\'re not alone in feeling conflicted.  "
1439,Thanks Kristine! And I do see myself having a management position in the future. I think one of my strongest assets is my ability to lead people.
1440,"Thanks for adding your thoughts here, Joanne.  How have our sessions at the school met or challenged your expectations?  "
1441,"Josh, great story! I can understand how frustrated you must have felt, but I'm glad that you got through it. It's often easier and better to focus on how you should adapt to your environment and your teammates. It's also nice to see that you acknowledge your professor for what you've learned. Not many students give credit where it's due nor do they appreciate adversity in situations. I think it's great that you learned and grew from a frustrating situation- that's an invaluable experience that not many people take away from their time in college."
1442,"Josh, thanks for sharing your story! It sounds like there's a conflict of interest within your group or within the entire class. If people cannot find the time to make it to a group meeting or pull their weight in a group project, it sounds like they might not be interested in the course or that they are not passionate about Project Management. I'm glad that you got through it and understood the value of working together and priority setting. "
1443,"Hi Ololade, thank you for sharing your experience. You made a good point and observation about the impact of one's actions versus their intent. One's intent is meaningless unless they make an effort to show how dedicated and interested they are in learning about cultures. I'd like to hear more about your perspective on this as well as your thoughts about your own intent and actions. What did you learn about the actions/interests (or lack thereof) of others on the trip? How does that shape your appreciate and passion for other cultural understanding? "
1444,"My favorite quote is by Carl Jung and he says that """"Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves."""" This is a great story and a great example of how to overcome adversity in the workplace. Working on a project/organization that you're passionate about with people who work differently from your own style can be very challenging and difficult, but I encourage you to think about how this situation would pay off in the long run and in your career. Although it might be difficult for you consider right now, I think that you'll learn a lot about your strengths and have a great opportunity to work on your weaknesses when it comes to working with people who are different from you. The best part of experiencing a problem is the ability to work through it and learning from it."
1445,"Hey Wesley, I think it's great that you learned and realized what the power of being a leader entails. Teamwork, collaboration and communication is very important in any industry, but particularly in technology ultimately leading to innovation and impactful changes. I'd like to learn more about what made you come to this realization that teamwork is important and how your role as a leader """"diminished""""?"
1446,"Wesley, I think you made a great decision and it sounds like you learned a lot from your experience. You made a great observation about how egos have no place in the workplace and that's true. It can be personally difficult and challenging to look past one's ego and to let others take the lead without being offended and it's very admirable of you to reflect and learn from this situation. As you grow and develop your skills, I think it would be valuable for you to reflect upon your desire to be team leader in the first place and what made you change your mind."
1447,"Anthony, it sounds like you've learned a lot during your time abroad in Russia. I'm glad you're able to capture your out of classroom experiences on this platform. I think it says a lot about your awareness if you can reflect about specific experiences about your summer abroad. I'm sure that you realized by now that your observations are very meaningful and valuable for you in the future to allow reflect upon your interactions with a diverse group of people in different perspectives."
1448,"Anthony, thanks for sharing your experience about your mission trip. Similar to your entry about your study abroad experience, it's important to take a step back and reflect upon your interactions and experiences with people who come from different backgrounds. I think one major take away from your diverse experiences is to be able to take a step back and meet your audience with empathy and self-awareness so you can effectively get through to them with your perspective and to influence them with your passions and interests."
1449,"Morgan, thanks for sharing your post. It's great that you're realizing the importance of dialogue and perspective. I think it's wonderful that you're able to take a step back from your own views and perspectives to learn about others and to discover more about yourself and your interests. It also sounds like you're taking healthy risks and are keeping yourself informed about different cultures that are different from what you're familiar with. "
1450,"Morgan, this is a wonderful story and experience! It sounds like you give and take away a lot of different lessons from this experience and I'm glad you're able to capture it on your Live It portfolio. It also sounds like a wonderful way to engage conversations with people who aren't familiar or comfortable with the English language and you're able to help her improve and adapt to her environment. I think this experience also helps you develop and expand your level of empathy for people who come from different backgrounds and experiences and that, alone, is invaluable. "
1451,"Hey Josh, thanks for sharing your post about what you learned from your IST class and the importance of UX/UI. Would like to hear more about what in particular about UX/UI interests you the most and how you can apply it to your internship at SURGE!"
1452,It's great that you were able to look past the difficulty and burden of having to take Spanish 3 your senior year. It sounds like you are also grateful and thankful for the experience. I'm glad you were able to look past it and find the benefits of taking the class. Having a great teacher and influencer can really make a difference and help you better connect with the material by engaging you in different ways in and out of the classroom.
1453,Hi thank you for the comment. Are you the only one who are responsible to make comments?
1454,"Well said. An added value is that when you write a reflection, peers can communicate with each other on that specific reflection or summary.  Thanks! "
1455,"This seems like it was a great experience. I encourage you to think about how debating someone in a professional manner can stretch across your career opportunities. It is a tough skill to master, but allows you to grow professionally."
1456,"Dominic, I am so happy to read your story and know why you like cars so much.  Always have curiosity on everything. Stay hungry, stay foolish."
1457,That was an awesome story Dominic! It's awesome to hear about how you could  connect with you grandfather.
1458,"Chloe, I am glad that you find another interest. Having and learning more skills will do no harm to your future career. "
1459,"Barry, though people say video games are bad for children because they make you addicted to virtual world, I believe that video games help you be more creative. I am so happy for you."
1460,I am excited for you! i am very glad that you are taking up this leadership role. I know you will do exceptional!
1461,I am so glad you enjoyed your time in Spain. Getting to experience another culture is a very fulfilling experience!
1462,That's a great lesson to take away from your experience Chloe. We all need things that bring joy to ourselves. Keep up the good work!
1463,France is a very beautiful place. I have been there a couple of times with my family. French is one of the  three languages i speak. I know you will have fun with your family.
1464,"Hey Barry, its great to see that you got through your presentation. Confidence is key, good job!"
1465,I am glad you are a part of the band. I look forward to hearing you perform. Let me know the date of your first performance
1466,"Autumn, I am sure that you have done well in your swim competition, no matter what place you got. Every one of you should learn that the most important thing in your life is not reputation nor prizes, but friendship, experience, and what you have seen and listened. I am glad that you are grateful no matter what medal you got. Keep up the hard work!"
1467,"You or others in your network can comment on your entries. Professors could leave feedback on your experiences or entries, as well as other students. "
1468,Nice ATV! I also have one. Had a very similar situation.
1469,You forgot the space between the words each and other
1470,I like this entry the best because I feel like you expressed yourself the most.
1471,Thank you for saying I think that is very nice of you
1472,Capitalize the I s
1473,Make it longer please.
1474,It shows what you like and what you are good at. Nice!
1475,Sometimes I play basket ball with my friends and you did a good job on writing and explaining
1476,"Welcome to the team man. I come in every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Maybe I'll get to meet you one of those days."
1477,This was interesting to read. Its good that you found your own path and motivation to get into your field.
1478,"I am in the same boat man. I literally just go to classes, go to my internship, and do homework. #SeniorYearStruggles"
1479,"Dope story man, sounds interesting and I'm sure you gained a lot from that experience."
1480,"Sounds like a cool experience, you still might need a chiropractor though. #OldManBack"
1481,Sounds interesting man.
1482,"I like the story a lot man, sounds interesting and I can relate. I worked a few construction jobs in the past where I felt inexperienced; I know that feeling of doubt going in. Cool Story man!"
1483,"Hello Markia! I am happy to hear that you were able to get so much out of this trip, not only academically, but also, for yourself. Emotional intelligence is very hard to understand and many people go through life without understanding it. Yet, the fact that you were able to experience it, demonstrates the kind of person you are, a conscious student who wants to help enhance our world for every person that lives in it."
1484,"Hey Matt, thanks for sharing. You make a good point about how challenges and hardships can shape you to be more resilient in the end. Life presents often presents you with different opportunities to learn about yourself and they often come as challenges that you've never faced. These challenges allow you to learn about yourself like how do you overcome them? View them as opportunities to improve yourself"
1485,"Hey Emir! Welcome to the Surge family. I'm so glad to hear that you're adapting so well to your new internship! My role is to support you in ways that will help you develop and grow. My goal is to also foster that type of environment so you're able to collaborate with others with different skill sets and interests. Never hesitate to reach out to me with any questions, help, or feedback! :) "
1486,"Hey Braxton, I admire your discipline and dedication to getting your work done early to make time to relax. It's important to make some time to do that! I remember taking about 19 credits some semesters and I remember how overwhelming it was managing my work. What I found helpful was working with others when it comes to homework. That way studying comes easier and you'll learn things quicker! Good luck :) "
1487,"Hi Paulette! Thanks for stepping up to be the lead intern--it shows that you have a lot of initiative and that you are looking to challenge yourself in new ways. Way to go! When you led the meeting 2 weeks ago and last week, I thought you did a great job being confident! I know that this role takes time to get used to, but I know that from your work and attitude you'll be a great leader and supporter. "
1488,I think deciding to volunteer to help the homeless is great!  I wish you the best of luck in the future
1489,"19 Credits sounds like a headache. In that situation, it would seem good to work with others. "
1490,I agree Darrin. It was nice to see the kids working together.
1491,"I liked how you used a pink colored paper instead of just a plain white paper, it makes the portrait stand out. ;P"
1492,You were very kind hearted as a kid. Its also cool you were on the news B)
1493,Going in depth on which courses you have also taken definitely made it more appealing to those looking to see the experience you have in the arts. It sounds very educated and the diction definitely portrays your early professionalism in what you do and how you can analyze yourself.
1494,It is great that you are showing initiative! Keep up the good work.
1495,"In addition to this, I'd like to recommend all readers to read more about the Celtic holiday we know as Halloween. The events that occurred and lead up to the one we know are all very interesting."
1496,Great choice. Calla Lily is a beautiful flower and so is the art work. Well Done.
1497,"Hey Abigail! My name is Andrew, I work with Kristine who visited your class recently. Great piece of work! For only your second time using pastels it looks fantastic. You've done a great job identifying the soft skills you learned/experienced through this. These are so important to recognize throughout your life, as they aren't discussed in academia. Even though it was a tough drawing, you've done great and don't stop!"
1498,"Hey Hailey! My name is Andrew, I work with Kristine who visited your class recently. Your mission trip sounds really gratifying, and an awesome experience! It seems like you've taken some quality time reflecting on this experience, and identifying what you gained from it. Keep it up!"
1499,"It was very interesting to read your entry. I am happy to hear that although it took you a lot of time to complete the assignment you found it helpful, you found value in the experience. Being patient is definitely a virtue that is great to develop early in your career because you will be using it a lot throughout the year. Great job. And your piece is beautiful!"
1500,"I like the attention to detail of the eyebrows and the eye, but the irises could have a bit more detail to make this image more realistic."
1501,Challenges that take time to complete really help you build patience which is a valuable trait to have.
1502,"If you go move at the speed of sound, then you are moving at a super Sonic speed, not 'lite/light' speed."
1503,Great to see a self-starter! That's the sort of stuff we like to see in college or the workplace. Your initiative will accomplish great things. Keep up the good work!
1504,"Hey David, great story. Not only did you exemplify great communication skills, but it also sounds like you developed showed problem solving and teamwork. You managed to get on the same page with your co-captain and strive to work together to get on the same schedule to achieve the same goal. The skills you talk about here are traits every business needs to succeed."
1505,"Also, I think a picture would be a fun addition that would bring your story to life! "
1506,"SJ, what a well written post! Thanks for sharing your insights and feelings about how you felt about the miscommunication. You and the AFGG team did an excellent job working together to get the job done. In particular, I personally thought you had one of the best attitudes toward executing. Not once did I hear you complain. You were genuinely interested in solving the problem and working together and motivating your team. So props to you! :)"
1507,"Braxton, you and the team were responsible for so much before the event and you were one of the team members who contributed to the success of the game. You were one of the strongest and committed team members who showed determination and teamwork. You were also one of the most hardworking members of the team as you were willing to help others get things done. The team and the kids involve admire all the work you put in and you should be proud! Great job, Braxton and thank you. "
1508,I hope you were able to learn a lot about project management while being collaborative and results-driven!
1509,"Sounds exciting, SJ! Enjoy your trips :) I hope you see a lot of new things and learn a lot more! "
1510,Glad to hear you're enjoying your college life a lot more after switching! What do you love about IST and how did you see yourself change in the past year of you switching?
1511,"Ah, online SRA group work. I minored in SRA and finished most of my courses through world campus too. Doing group work with others online was not easy for me especially because students taking World Campus courses online were very different from what I expected. A lot of those who I worked with were moms/dads and in the military so coordinating times to meet with them virtually seemed almost impossible for me! What challenges are you facing right now?"
1512,"Emir, I'm sure you're having a difficult semester and I know it's really stressful! What I admire about what you said is being able to find the ability to redirect your attitude and to embrace the challenges you're facing. It wasn't too long ago that I was in the same shoes as you- juggling 18 credits, internships, and figuring out my future! (AHHH!!) It's all about how react and handle everything. In the process, you learn so much about yourself and what your capabilities and weaknesses are."
1513,It sounds like there are so many changes that are occuring in your life right now. I think it's very fitting of you to select adaptability as a tag because that's exactly what's going to be required of you in these coming months. I hope you see the value in the challenges you're enduring and learn a lot about yourself in the process.
1514,Cute. I see what you did there. Great post!
